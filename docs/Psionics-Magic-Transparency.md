## Overview
The default rule for the interaction of psionics and magic is simple: powers interact with spells and spells interact with powers in the same way a spell or normal spell-like ability interacts with another spell or spell-like ability. This is known as **psionics–magic transparency**.

## Core Transparency Rule
> **Psionics–Magic Transparency:** Though not explicitly called out in the spell descriptions or magic item descriptions, spells, spell-like abilities, and magic items that could potentially affect psionics do affect psionics. When the rule about psionics–magic transparency is in effect, it has the following ramifications.

## Ramifications Summary
Quick reference to the major points:

| Topic | Summary |
|-------|---------|
| Resistance | Spell resistance applies to powers; power resistance applies to spells; if a creature has one, it is assumed to have the other. |
| Dispelling | Spells that dispel magic affect powers of the same level using the same mechanics, and vice versa. |
| Detection | Detect Magic reveals powers; Detect Psionics reveals spells (with *Spellcraft* checks for discipline/school). |
| Dead Zones | Dead magic areas are also dead psionics areas. |
| Counterspelling | Powers generally cannot be counterspelled unless specifically stated; powers cannot counterspell spells. |
| Feats | Metamagic feats do not affect powers; metapsionic feats do not affect spells unless explicitly stated. |
| Stacking | Same-type bonuses from powers/spells do not stack; use the better value. Different types stack. |
| Overlapping Effects | Stronger identical effect applies; differing-results use last-applied; some effects render others irrelevant. |
| Mental Control | Multiple controllers may coexist; conflicting orders resolved by opposed Charisma checks. |
| Opposing/Negating | Opposite effects apply in order; some powers/spells negate or counter specific others. |
| Instantaneous | Instantaneous psionic/magical effects are cumulative. |

## Resistance (Spell & Power)
- **Spell resistance** is effective against **powers**, using the same mechanics.
- **Power resistance** is effective against **spells**, using the same mechanics as spell resistance.
- If a creature has one kind of resistance, it is assumed to have the other (ends are similar though brought about by different means).

## Dispelling
- All spells that **dispel magic** have equal effect against powers of the same level using the same mechanics.
- Conversely, powers that can dispel affect spells of the same level equivalently (when such mechanics are present).

## Detection (Detect Magic / Detect Psionics)
- **Detect Magic** detects powers, their number, strength, and location within 3 rounds.
  - A *Spellcraft check* is required to identify the discipline of a psionic aura.
- **Detect Psionics** detects spells, their number, strength, and location within 3 rounds.
  - A *Spellcraft check* is required to identify the school of magic.

## Dead Magic / Dead Psionics Areas
- **Dead magic areas** are also **dead psionics areas**.
- Unless specifically mentioned in a power’s description:
  - A power cannot be **counterspelled** when it is being manifested.
  - Powers cannot be used to **counterspell** a spell as it is being cast.

## Feat Interaction
- Unless specifically stated otherwise:
  - Feats such as **metamagic feats** that specifically affect spells do **not** affect powers.
  - Feats such as **metapsionic feats** that specifically affect powers do **not** affect spells.

## Stacking & Overlapping Effects
Powers or psionic effects usually work as described regardless of how many other powers, psionic effects, spells, or magical effects operate in the same area or on the same recipient.

General principles:
- Except in special cases, a power does **not** alter how another power or spell operates.
- When a power has a specific effect on other powers or spells, its description explains the effect (and vice versa for spells affecting powers).
- Several general rules apply when multiple effects operate simultaneously.

### Bonus Types
- Powers that provide bonuses or penalties (attack rolls, damage rolls, saving throws, attributes) usually do **not** stack with themselves.
- Two bonuses of the **same type** don’t stack even if from different sources (power vs. spell); use whichever gives the better result.
- **Different bonus types** stack if the effects are of different types.
- An unnamed bonus (e.g. "+2 bonus" instead of "+2 insight bonus") stacks with any bonus.

### Same Effect, Different Strengths
- If two or more similar/identical effects apply in the same area or on the same target at **different strengths**, only the **best** one applies.
- If one effect is dispelled or its duration expires, the other remains (if its own duration has not expired).

### Same Effect, Differing Results
- The same power or spell can sometimes produce varying effects if applied multiple times to the same recipient.
- The **last effect** in the series overrides previous ones.
- Previous spells or powers aren’t removed or dispelled; their effects are **irrelevant** while the final one lasts.

### Irrelevant Effects
- Sometimes, a power can render another power **irrelevant** (effectively superseding it without dispelling it).

### Multiple Mental Control Effects
- Psionic or magical effects that establish **mental control** can render one another irrelevant.
- Mental controls that do **not** remove the recipient’s ability to act usually **do not** interfere, though one may modify another.
- If controlled by two or more creatures, a target obeys each to the best of its ability within the limits of each control.
- **Conflicting orders** issued simultaneously require opposed **Charisma checks** between controllers to determine which is obeyed.

### Opposing / Negating
- Powers and spells with **opposite effects** apply normally; bonuses, penalties, and changes accrue in the order applied.
- Some powers and spells specifically **negate** or **counter** each other—this is a special effect noted in the description.

### Instantaneous Effects
- Two or more magical or psionic effects with **instantaneous durations** work **cumulatively** when they affect the same object, place, or creature.

## Reference Notes
- All wording preserved; only structural and formatting changes applied for readability.
- Transparency assumptions apply unless an exception is explicitly stated in a power or spell description.

---

## Quick Recap (Bullet Form)
- Transparency: Spells and powers interact identically where mechanics overlap.
- Resistance: Possessing one implies the other.
- Dispelling: Works cross-system at matching levels.
- Detection: Each detects the other’s auras with *Spellcraft* for discipline/school.
- Dead Zones: Magic dead = psionics dead.
- Counterspelling: Generally not available to powers unless stated.
- Feats: Metamagic ≠ powers; Metapsionic ≠ spells unless exception.
- Stacking: Same-type bonuses don’t stack; different types do.
- Overlap: Strongest similar effect applies; last differing-result effect overrides.
- Mental Control: Multiple controls coexist; Charisma checks break ties.
- Opposing: Order matters; specific negation noted case-by-case.
- Instantaneous: Always cumulative.
