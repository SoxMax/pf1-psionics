      <p>A primarily sea-faring race, maenads are a dichotomy. To outsiders,
      they appear to be extremely reserved, yet they are rumored to be
      exceptionally emotional. Both sides are actually true. As a race, maenads
      must maintain control over their internal emotional turmoil, except when
      they unleash these bottled-up emotions in powerful displays. Born with
      raging emotions that threaten to tear their psyche apart unless properly
      controlled, maenads do not know why they have these powerful emotions
      warring within them. Their legends speak of being wronged by an ancient
      deity that the maenads revolted against and overthrew, resulting in the
      emotional curse they maintain to date. Maenads have a proclivity to
      martial studies, as it gives an outlet for their bottled
      emotions.</p><p><strong>Physical Description:</strong> Standing slightly
      taller than humans, roughly shoulder to shoulder with half-orcs, maenads
      are physically impressive. Male maenads are usually equal in height, but
      slightly heavier than females. They have thick, dark hair on their heads,
      but lack any other hair on their body; instead their skin is covered in
      flecks of sparkling crystals, giving them a peculiar sparkle. The
      coloration of these crystals define the look for each individual maenad,
      ranging from pale white to jet black, and many believe that the coloration
      is determined by their most powerful emotion. Maenads are naturally
      graceful and have fine features, possessing an elf-like beauty. They
      prefer heavier clothing, and wear armor if available, but tend to go
      barefoot, especially when aboard a ship.</p><p><strong>Society:</strong>
      As a primarily sea-faring race, maenads tend to live either in coastal
      regions, or on islands and archipelagos. The nature of the ocean tends to
      soothe the internal turmoil of the maenad mind, for the calm waters that
      can turn to a deadly tidal wave are something to which a maenad can
      relate. As a result, much of maenad society revolves around the ocean:
      fishing, sailing, and swimming are the main activities of a maenad
      society. Most maenad villages tend to be no larger than a few hundred
      residents. Many maenads turn to tradition and ritual as ways to control
      their emotions. In some villages, this ritualization can take over, where
      every aspect of life is defined by a ritual that must be followed,
      although this sort of extreme situation is uncommon among the race as a
      whole.</p><p><strong>Relations:</strong> Maenads are typically distant
      towards other races, although they are most comfortable with humans, who
      have various temperaments that are not very different from their own. The
      open emotions of halflings, gnomes, and xephs confuse maenads, who have a
      hard time understanding living in such a capricious and carefree fashion.
      Elven society flows at a good pace for most maenads, and the lightness of
      being soothes a maenad’s spirit. While the dwarves are often civilized,
      their brazen ways, physical tendencies, and love of drink tend to be
      off-putting for maenaeds, although they respect the dwarves‘ ability to
      hold a grudge. Maenads view the violent dispositions of half-orcs and
      half-giantsas a good excuse to channel their emotions in combat, but
      recognize that they should partake in such events
      sparingly.</p><p><strong>Alignment and Religion:</strong> Maenads prefer
      to worship gods of dichotomy to represent the dual nature of the maenads’
      emotion. Most maenads are lawful, seeing the structure of rules as helpful
      toward maintaining composure and self-control. Generally, they seek to
      help others also maintain their own self-control, and have a tendency
      toward good alignment as a result.</p><p><strong>Male Names:</strong>
