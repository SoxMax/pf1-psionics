      <p>Confused with lizardfolk by the ignorant, ophiduans stand out among the
      other civilized nations in a fashion similar to the dromites, having a
      more monstrous and distinct appearance than most humanoids. Where other
      races share soft skin, flat teeth, protruding ears, and a tendency to be
      partially or fully covered in hair, ophiduans are distinct and very proud
      of it. Organized and expansionistic in nature, ophiduans view talent and
      skill, especially with psionics, as the key component for social station,
      rather than wealth, heritage, or influence.</p><p><strong>Physical
      Description:</strong> Reptilian scales cover the ophiduans’ hairless
      bodies, and their yellow, slitted eyes and sharp teeth give them a
      striking appearance. They stand tall, often a head above most humans, but
      are typically slimmer than humans, being lithe in build. Ophiduans have no
      ears, and their ridged brows are often what define their face. Most
      ophiduans are green-scaled, but there are those of blue, purple, black, or
      yellow in tone, a trait which is passed along to progeny. The only common
      color among all ophiduans is the dull grey of their stomachs, which
      reflects their common ancestry.</p><p><strong>Society:</strong> Ophiduans
      are sometimes viewed as being cold in personality because they are
      reptilian in nature, but that does not define their society. Rather, a
      strong meritocracy defines them; to an ophiduan, leadership is constantly
      earned, as are most things in life. Respect, money, and friends, all are
      earned and the ophiduan society reflects this. There is very little
      compassion towards strangers, even within a society, but friends and
      family are expected to sacrifice for one another. Ophiduans tend not to be
      satisfied with themselves, feeling a drive to become better, seeking the
      elusive state of perfection. A leader amongst the ophiduans is often a
      very capable politician, a warrior, and psionically gifted, for otherwise
      he or she would not have risen to such a position, as he or she would not
      have proven capable of leading. This results in the ophiduan societies
      tendency to become organized and expansionistic in nature, as they strive
      to improve their cities, lands, and surrounding areas. Sometimes they
      expand by war, sometimes by politics, but never does an ophiduan society
      find any form of calm or stability, for it is always seeking to become
      better, trying to become perfect.</p><p><strong>Relations:</strong>
      Ophiduans view most other races as strange, sometimes even soft. The
      whimsical ways of gnomes and halflings tend to irritate them, humans seem
      to constantly shift between their goals, and half-elves seem to be
      confused about who they are. Ophiduans can respect the dedication of the
      elves, but cannot relate to their perceived inactivity and slow-acting
      ways. Dwarves impress the ophiduans with their ability to build lasting
      empires and their perfection of the crafts, but their inability to adapt
      and to strive forward annoys them. Half-orcs and half-giants, strangely
      enough, are often appreciated, for if anything they tend to be direct and
      strive towards action, something ophiduans can appreciate. Xeph are valued
      for their individual philosophy, but disdained as a society for their
      seeming acceptance to maintain what they have and not to improve or
      expand. Dromites are appreciated for they too have a constant drive
      towards a goal. Few ophiduans know what elans are and thus have no
      specific relations to them.</p><p><strong>Alignment and Religion:</strong>
      Ophiduans tend to revere their greatest leaders as gods in the flesh,
      although they never go so far as to actually worship them; rather an
      ophiduan will follow the great leader and be inspired. The gods of other
      races and religions are therefore also viewed like this, as
      representations of great individuals to be admired, aspired towards, and
      emulated. However, ophiduans also believe that each individual carries
      within them the seed of divinity if they strive hard enough, and thus
      ophiduans typically do not bow before any gods. While varying between good
      and evil, almost every ophiduan tend towards lawful, for the structure of
      a stable society is necessary to achieve
      perfection.</p><p><strong>Adventurers:</strong> Striving for perfection is
      the typical reason an ophiduan begins adventuring. What other way to train
      yourself, test yourself, and raise yourself up towards divinity, than to
      meet and overcome challenges.</p><p><strong>Male Names:</strong> Mixal,
