  description:
    value: <p>Not being born in the traditional sense means that the elan idea of family is a bit different from that of most humanoids. Elans tend to identify with a particular “generation” of their kindred. A generation in this case means a group of elans with similar characteristics that were created by the same council. The first elan generation, of which a few still walk the worlds, was denoted by red, curly hair and a pale complexion coupled with vibrant green eyes.</p>
