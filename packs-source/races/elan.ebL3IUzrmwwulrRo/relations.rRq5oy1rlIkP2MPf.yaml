  description:
    value: <p>Because elans are created from a wide variety of races they generally do not have preferences about the races they associate with. Instead, they judge each individual by the content of their character and not by physical form. It is worth noting that this attitude combined with their aberrant nature can sometimes land them in hot water for associating with those deemed racially inferior by the surrounding population. As they grow older, elans do tend to associate more with those of lawful or neutral alignments, while in their younger days associates are often within a step or two of the elan's own alignment.</p>
