  description:
    value: <p>While its enclaves are few and far between, there is indeed an elan society, though it is more akin to the structure of a secret society. Elans tend to recognize one another on sight, but others can have a hard time separating them from normal races. In cities and places where many people gather, elans will generally strive to find a way to meet each other, often in secret to avoid implicating each other or raising suspicions. Elans come together to share wisdom, to learn, and to help their peers. Often this learning is divided into layers, circles, strata, or other forms of separation, which leads to a mysticism surrounding the societies of elans. Sometimes elans name their order after something symbolic, such as the Brotherhood of the Heavenly Lantern; at other times a society's name is more direct, such as with the Enlightened Order of Ksaren. Elans, if anything, are infiltrators, preferring to live within the societies of others, striving to become part of their culture and ways, avoiding standing out and gaining unwanted attention.</p>
