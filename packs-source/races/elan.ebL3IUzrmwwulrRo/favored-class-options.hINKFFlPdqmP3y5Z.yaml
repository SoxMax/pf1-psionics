      <p>Elans are created rather than born. Those chosen by the secretive elan councils come from a variety of races, all of whom shed their prior form to become psionically awakened, superior life forms. Drawing sustenance from their own inherent psionic energy, they do not age or require sleep. (Elan spend four hours a night in a trance state which is the equivalent of eight hours of sleep for most humanoids). They are incapable of breeding, instead “uplifting” other sentient beings to create more of their race. Among the psionic races they are sometimes referred to as the Created, which can be used as praise or an insult depending on the source.
      </p>
      <p>Little is known of the ritual used to create new elans. It is a jealously guarded secret known only to the inner circle of a few of the oldest councils. These groups, called triads, are composed of three of the eldest elans. Each one has two thirds of the ritual, known only to that individual and his apprentice. These six elans are guarded by elite psychic warriors and creche defenders.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Physical Description</strong>: No matter what the base humanoid stock was, an elan's final form resembles that of a human in height and weight. Unlike humans, they seem to brim with energy, with sparkling eyes, shining skin, and hair that at times seems to almost have a life of its own. Elans can often pass for humans if not observed too closely or if they keep their features shrouded.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Society</strong>: While its enclaves are few and far between, there is indeed an elan society, though it is more akin to the structure of a secret society. Elans tend to recognize one another on sight, but others can have a hard time separating them from normal races. In cities and places where many people gather, elans will generally strive to find a way to meet each other, often in secret to avoid implicating each other or raising suspicions. Elans come together to share wisdom, to learn, and to help their peers. Often this learning is divided into layers, circles, strata, or other forms of separation, which leads to a mysticism surrounding the societies of elans. Sometimes elans name their order after something symbolic, such as the Brotherhood of the Heavenly Lantern; at other times a society's name is more direct, such as with the Enlightened Order of Ksaren. Elans, if anything, are infiltrators, preferring to live within the societies of others, striving to become part of their culture and ways, avoiding standing out and gaining unwanted attention.
      </p>
      <p>Little is known to non-elans about the councils that select and transform mortals into new elans. Even new elans may not know all the members of the council that created them, as a precaution against discovery from outsiders. New elans are typically chosen, although rare cases of mortals petitioning an elan council for transformation have occurred.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Alignment and Religion</strong>: Elans do not often embrace religion, and when they do it is either to worship deities with the Knowledge domain, a psionic Godmind, or a deity known as the Prodigy. Elans do not tend to favor any particular alignment in their younger days and elans exist across all points of the moral compass. As the centuries drag on they often drift towards lawful outlooks and favor neutrality between good and evil.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Names</strong>: An elan's name is something that is chosen when he first becomes an elan. As a result, while there are similarities in names among elans of a common generation, the names themselves can vary extensively. It is said that in exceedingly rare cases an elan will keep the name from his or her former life, although there are none known who have done so. No living elan has ever been documented using his or her former name.
      </p>
      <p>Elans do not have family names unless they have adopted one appropriate for the culture they live in.
      </p>
      <p><em>Male Names</em>: Armallo, Edalph, Ederic, Grith, Relloquin, Seldred, Vir, Zattred
      </p>
      <p><em>Female Names</em>: Asatra, Ciadara, Jelinka, Nelida, Quira, Tarrin, Vialle, Xian
      </p>
      <p><strong>Aging and Death</strong>: Elans do not age, so when an elan dies, it is usually due to accident or intentional violence. Since death is so rare among them, elans are normally shocked by even an acquaintance's death.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Clans and Families</strong>: Not being born in the traditional sense means that the elan idea of family is a bit different from that of most humanoids. Elans tend to identify with a particular “generation” of their kindred. A generation in this case means a group of elans with similar characteristics that were created by the same council. The first elan generation, of which a few still walk the worlds, was denoted by red, curly hair and a pale complexion coupled with vibrant green eyes.
      </p>
      <p>Likewise, instead of clans, elans congregate in orders and societies based on common interests and geographic proximity. While an individual elan can be of any alignment, these orders tend to be composed of elans who only differ from each other by one alignment step, two at most. This means a lawful good order might have chaotic or neutral good members, but usually not evil ones. These groups are usually kept secret from non-elans, but there are recorded exceptions. The Verdant Order, for instance, lives in harmony with forest elves and local druids, bound together by their intense bond to the forces of nature.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Language and Script</strong>: Elans use the Common tongue as their native language, since their numbers come from members of all the humanoid races.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Relations</strong>: Because elans are created from a wide variety of races they generally do not have preferences about the races they associate with. Instead, they judge each individual by the content of their character and not by physical form. It is worth noting that this attitude combined with their aberrant nature can sometimes land them in hot water for associating with those deemed racially inferior by the surrounding population. As they grow older, elans do tend to associate more with those of lawful or neutral alignments, while in their younger days associates are often within a step or two of the elan's own alignment.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Adventurers</strong>: Those selected to become elans are often naturally inquisitive and curious, making them ready nomads and explorers. Exploration allows them to challenge themselves and therefore grow and develop in their abilities. If anything, elans can fear becoming placid, for that will calcify their thinking, leading them to wallow in stasis. Many elans avoid this by adventuring, pitching themselves against all manner of monsters and quests to find a better path.
      </p>
      <p><em>Aegis</em>: Some elans devote their psionic energy to evolving their physical form. These elans embrace the aberrant archetype of the aegis, which dispenses with the astral suit and allows its practitioner to make changes directly to his own body.
      </p>
      <p><em>Cryptic</em>: Being closer to the patterns of energy that make up the multiverse, elans make excellent cryptics. They see the exploration of patterns as a continuation of the journey begun with their transformation.
      </p>
      <p><em>Monk</em>: The discipline and focus of the monk's lifestyle is a natural fit for many elans, as there are many similarities in the methods used to harness both <em>ki</em> and psionic power. Most elan monks are also psionicists, eventually becoming psychic fists.
      </p>
      <p><em>Oracle</em>: Divine magic is not an intuitive course for beings as steeped in psionics as elans, but it is not an unknown path for them. Some elans have the path of the oracle thrust on them by fate. In doctrine, such a fate is referred to as “the divine and considered imbalance.”
      </p>
      <p><em>Psion</em>: Becoming a psion is a natural choice for any elan thanks to their natural psionic energies, and so elans embrace the psion's path more than they do any other. Elan psions see their arts as the organic evolution of their new state of being.
      </p>
      <p><em>Psychic Warrior</em>: Martially-inclined elans most often pursue the path of the psychic warrior. A blend of physical and mental training has great appeal to them, especially among the followers of the Prodigy.
      </p>
      <p><em>Soulknife</em>: An elan's body is suffused with psionic energy at the most basic level. When in a trance these energies wash through the elan, repairing and retuning her physical form. Some elans experiment with these energy flows, developing new abilities that allow them to form psionic weapons. Starkly physical, elan soulknives are a wonder to behold in combat.
      </p>
      <p><em>Vitalist</em>: Some elans expand upon their natural resilience by learning to use their powers to heal others through the creation of a joint psionic field that encompasses their chosen companions, which represents a natural extension of their natural ability for self-repletion. Elan vitalists are considered some of the best in the known world.
      </p>
      <p><em>Wilder</em>: Some elans, particularly those of red-haired, fair-skinned generations and the dark-haired, olive-skinned generation, are more volatile in temperament. For those elans whose passions rule their intellects, the wilder's talents are a more suitable fit than those of the psion.
