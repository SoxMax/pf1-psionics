  description:
    value: <p>An elan's name is something that is chosen when he first becomes an elan. As a result, while there are similarities in names among elans of a common generation, the names themselves can vary extensively. It is said that in exceedingly rare cases an elan will keep the name from his or her former life, although there are none known who have done so. No living elan has ever been documented using his or her former name.</p>
