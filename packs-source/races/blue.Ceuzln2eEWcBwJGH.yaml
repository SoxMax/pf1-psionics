      <p>Once thought to be a subrace of the goblins, blues are related to
      goblins, being a goblinoid race, but are actually defined as their own
      race. Able to interbreed with goblins, similar to humans interbreeding
      with elves, blues often infiltrate goblin tribes to procreate with the
      females of the tribe, having a limited population of blue females to
      choose from. Many blues with strong psionic ability learn to control their
      physical form using psionics to assume the look of a normal goblin,
      thereby allowing easier integration into a goblin tribe. The blood of
      blues runs stronger than goblins, and therefore a tribe that knowingly or
      unknowingly allows blues to breed with them will over a matter of a few
      generations be composed completely of blues. Because of this, the blues
      were once hunted into near extinction by their goblin kin, prompting their
      stealthier and cautious ways. The blue elders will often breed and then
      leave a tribe, looking for a new place to spread their blood before it is
      destroyed.</p><p><strong>Physical Description: </strong>Short with
      leathery blue hide, large eyes and ears and a mouth filled with fangs,
      blues stand between 3 and 4 feet tall, with males slightly taller and
      heavier than females. Most blues have black hair on their heads, although
      some choose to go bald. To most, the blue is simply an oddly-colored
      goblin. Very few things make them stand out from their racial cousins, at
      least physically, aside from their skin tone.</p><p><strong>Society:
      </strong>Where goblins are disorganized, driven by their passions and need
      for activity, blues are quite the opposite. They are determined, focused,
      and driven to organization and structure. A tribe of goblins that doesn't
      kill a newborn blue will often come to be dominated by that blue, whose
      natural organizational skills and intelligence allows it to either rule
      the tribe outright, or manipulate the less intelligent goblins. These
      tribes tend to become focused and unified, whipped into structure not
      necessarily by the leadership qualities of the blue, but by his psionic
      power and intelligence. As a result, most of the dominant goblin societies
      are actually lead by a powerful blue; the few tribes of only blues that
      have popped up tend to welcome order and competition, finding common cause
      with the ophiduans.</p><p><strong>Relations: </strong>While driven and
      intelligent, most blues are colored by the dark ways of the tribes where
      they grew up. These blues tend to look down on all other races and wish to
      dominate and enslave them, which naturally makes them enemies to most
      races, but even a more mild-natured or civilized blue will be met by
      suspicion by half-giants, elves, dwarves, gnomes and dromites, while the
      maenad and ophiduan societies often find much in common with a blue's
      worldview, seeing the need for structure and order, which can equate to
      expansionistic and conquering tendencies.</p><p><strong>Alignment and
      Religion: </strong>Few blues are religious, believing themselves to be
      superior to the weak-willed people around them that need supernatural
      crutches to cope with a hostile world. Most blues tend to be lawful evil,
      tainted by their lives among the goblin tribes. Laws tend to protect the
      selfish more than the altruistic and therefore a blue would rather learn
      to use the rules than break them.</p><p><strong>Adventurers:
      </strong>Blues often become adventurers having been driven out by their
      home tribe, or they come from one of the few existing blue tribes. Even
      so, to wander means that they are either desperate (often for power) or
      cocky and unafraid. Blues find adventuring a means to an end, a way for
      them to become rich, powerful, and connected, with death one of the
      possible outcomes. To a blue, that is a fair bargain to be
      made.</p><p><strong>Names: </strong>Most blues outside of goblin society
      take a name from other humanoids, which means that their naming
      conventions are as varied as that of all other races combined. However,
      many often add a descriptive title, such as “Oman the Magnificent” or
      “Andra the Wild” to enhance their individuality.</p>
