      <p>Born not of a mother or father, but created, elans were once mortal
      beings. Built by a shadowy council to live as psionically awakened
      superior life forms, elans are capable of sustaining themselves with
      nothing but the power of the mind. Elans are no longer true mortals,
      having been unfettered by a secret ritual that created this new race and
      reborn anew, with but wisps and fragments of memories of their previous
      lives. Incapable of breeding, elans expand their numbers by choosing
      members of other races, most often humans, and transforming them into new
      elans. This would pose a problem for the continuation of the race, except
      elans do not die of old age. The secrets of the transformation ritual are
      typically limited to the elite members of the elan secret society that
      exists, and they take these secrets to the grave before sharing them with
      lesser beings. Elans are often chosen for being exceptional in some way:
      sometimes it is because they excel in physical challenges, other times it
      is because of their quick wit or sharp intellect, or in some cases a
      natural ability to work with the psionic arts. But none of the elans could
      ever be described as normal, mediocre, or standard. While most elans, even
      those of non-human origin, physically resemble humans, there is usually
      something that stands out about every elan.</p><p><strong>Physical
      Description:</strong> With a diverse physical makeup, dependent on the
      will and whim of the council, there is one thing in common amongst all
      elans: they are literally brimming with energy, psionic energy. Their eyes
      seem to shine, their skin seems to sparkle, and their hair seems to be
      made of strands of color in the wind. Elans typically resemble humans in
      size and weight, with males typically slightly taller and heavier than
      females. Even those elans who were selected from other races will be
      transformed to more closely match humans in size and shape, at the
      direction of the council. Elans under a particular council will tend to
      have similar physical appearance, with the previous council favoring pale
      skin, red hair, and young in appearance, while the current council has
      started to favor darker hair and tanned skin. Elans will adopt the type of
      dress and physical style of whatever society they are insinuating, the
      better to avoid detection.</p><p>Elans do not sleep as mortals do, instead
      entering a deep meditative trance for 4 hours a day. Resting in this
      fashion grants the elan the same benefits that other races gain from 8
      hours of sleep. The elan spends the time in this trance renewing her body
      by suffusing it with psionic energy, repairing wounds, and keeping the
      tissues and organs healthy.</p><p><strong>Society:</strong> While few and
      far between, there is indeed an elan society, but it is more akin to the
      structure of a secret society. Elans tend to recognize one another at
      sight, but others can have a hard time separating them from normal races.
      In cities and places where many people gather, elans will generally strive
      to find a way to meet each other, often in secret to avoid implicating
      each other or raising suspicions. Elans come together to share wisdom, to
      learn, and to help their peers. Often this learning is defined into
      layers, circles, strata, or other forms of separation, which leads to a
      mysticism surrounding the societies of elans. Sometimes elans name their
      order after something symbolical, such as the Brotherhood of the Heavenly
      Lantern; at other times it is more direct, such as the Enlightened Order
      of Ksaren. Elans, if anything, are infiltrators, preferring to live within
      the societies of others, striving to become part of their culture and
      ways, avoiding standing out and gaining unwanted attention. Many elans
      become wanderers because over time, others may take notice that the elan
      does not age and start to ask questions. For this reason, elans can be
      said to be nomadic, albeit at a very long cycle. Little is known to
      non-elans about the council that selects and transforms mortals into new
      elans, even new elans may not know all the members of the council, as a
      precaution from discovery from outsiders. New elans are typically chosen,
      although rare cases of mortals petitioning the elan council for
      transformation have occurred.</p><p><strong>Relations:</strong> Coming
      from a diverse range of races, the elans will look for the individual
      rather than the race. They know that they, as a race, are created for
      their individual characteristics rather than their racial background, and
      because of this, they can seem to treat members of other races unevenly,
      being friendly to half-orcs, joking with dwarves, and stern and distant
      towards halflings and gnomes. This is only an illusion of perception, for
      it is the individual that is treated, not the race itself. For this
      reason, elans are both loved and despised; they break stereotypes in ways
      that often make them stand out like a sore thumb.</p><p><strong>Alignment
      and Religion:</strong> Those elans who do embrace a religion tend to
      revere gods of psionics or the mind. Being composed and enlightened does
      not necessarily carry with it any specific moral views, and for this
      reason, there are elans of every kind of alignment. Many tend over time to
      drift towards lawful neutral, finding an ease with laws and regulations,
      but not caring deeply for or against other people, preferring solitude.
      Younger elans embrace everything on the alignment spectrum, sometimes
      radically changing moral compass in an attempt to find their way on their
      new journey on the road of
      immortality.</p><p><strong>Adventurers:</strong> As natural nomads, and
      often culled from a naturally inquisitive and curious mindset, elans are
      explorers. Exploring allows them to challenge themselves and therefore
      grow and develop in their abilities. If anything, elans can fear becoming
      placid, for that will calcify their thinking, leading them to wallow in
      stasis. Many who are caught in this break the cycle by adventuring,
      pitching themselves against all manner of monsters and quests to find a
      better path.</p><p><strong>Male Names:</strong> Armend, Absylon, Edam,
