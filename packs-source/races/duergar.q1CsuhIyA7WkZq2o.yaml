    value: >-
      <p>There are stories of those who dug too deep into the bowels of the
      earth, spelunkers who opened ancient cities and awakened things from
      beyond our worst nightmares. There these miners discovered creatures more
      akin to gods sleeping beneath the earth, beings neither demonic nor
      angelic in their forms and minds. There was a clan of dwarves who cast all
      caution aside, tunneling deep, following richer and richer mineral veins
      until they found something that shattered their minds, broke their bodies,
      and remade them in a new image. What returned from that unknown place
      where logic no longer made sense, where the laws of physics did not always
      hold sway, and the weak minds of the current races couldn't fathom were
      the duergars, who warned of a slumbering deity who would rule over all
      other deities if awakened. Duergars are reminiscent of the dwarves they
      once were, in that they are short and broad, of powerful stature, but that
      is where any likeness is lost. Their ways can seem to be callous and
      cruel, but it is from their experience deep in the earth that they are
      motivated. Even actions such as slavery are not only acceptable but
      encouraged if it helps to continue the projects that keep That Which
      Sleeps Beneath from arising.</p><p><strong>Physical Description:</strong>
      Duergars' eyes shine with a madness that has touched their entire
      bloodline. Their ashen skin is devoid of nearly all hair, except on their
      head and face, although male duergars tend to have a bald pate. While
      short and broad, standing roughly 4 1/2 feet tall, the rippling muscles of
      the duergars make most people uneasy, for beneath their skin, the muscles
      move of their own accord, snaking and twisting. Many duergars have long
      scars, often caused by their own
      delusions.</p><p><strong>Society:</strong> Having witnessed what they
      perceive to be the truth of this world, there is no joy amongst the
      duergars, only eternal toil. Deep underground, deeper than the dwarven
      kingdoms, they toil on deranged constructions that twist and turn in ways
      that give others headaches and nightmares. Driven by an intense need to
      create and build, those who stop to listen hear the duergars humming and
      singing while building. The duergars themselves claim they are saving the
      world by distracting the terrible deity that slumbers beneath the earth,
      keeping it asleep for the sake of all life. Their society has no joys, no
      color, no individuality. Everyone wears the same clothes, the same armor,
      the same weapons, and by birth they seem to know the lullaby chants of the
      mentally unbalanced.</p><p><strong>Relations:</strong> To the duergars, it
      is the other races who are mad. As a terrible monster that is beyond what
      words can describe threatens to awaken and devour the world and the gods
      themselves, the other races squander their lives away, playing useless
      games and waging meaningless war. Xephs, dromites, halflings and gnomes
      can provoke the insane rage of the duergars, for their constant activity
      threatens the duergar view of how to keep the titanic god sleeping. Other
      races are most often ignored or disdained for their failure to recognize
      the truth and the deadly threat. Most other races avoid the mad duergars,
      but there are those who wonder if the duergars might not be insane, and
      might actually be correct, and how terrifying that possibility might
      be.</p><p><strong>Alignment and Religion:</strong> Almost all duergars
      worship the sleeping horror by working, building, constructing, and
      redefining, while humming and singing the twisted lullaby that runs
      through their minds. All other gods are inconsequential, for the horrid
      thing, That Which Sleeps Beneath, will consume all if it awakens. Lawful
      neutral, or perhaps lawful evil, tend to be the natural tendencies of the
      duergars, for they see no use in helping others with their pointless daily
      problems when they are busy saving the world from the threat of imminent
      destruction.</p><p><strong>Adventurers:</strong> Duergars only become
      adventurers because their unique brand of insanity plagues them with
      visions and whispers of the peace that others have in their heads. Driven
      by a need to fulfill these visions and quiet the voices within, duergars
      often seem obsessed with what they are doing. While capable companions,
      many are scared to adventure with duergars, for their tendency to whisper
      in their sleep and their skin's unusual undulations can be
      unnerving.</p><p><strong>Note On Names:</strong> Duergars abstain from
      traditional naming conventions, often viewing names as a pointless
      exercise in a doomed world. When young, they are ‘child,' and then become
      ‘woman' and ‘man'. Amongst the other races, they often take on a name
      because their companions ask them to; this name is often matter-of-fact
      and describes their perceived role in the
      world.</p><p><strong>Names:</strong> Hammer, Smith, War, Hunter, Tailor,
      Shieldbearer, Slayer, Hatemonger</p>
