  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Believed to have been created centuries ago during a great war between
      psionic nations, the race of creatures referred to as the forgeborn were
      left to their own devices within the barren wasteland the war left behind.
      A hybridization of flesh and minerals, the forgeborn are varied in
      appearance and form, but were all created by merging psionically-empowered
      materials with the body of a humanoid to fashion a new creature.</p><p>The
      race seeks out humanoids to transform in order to increase their numbers
      and some say resume the conflict for which they were created. Although
      little is known about the creation process by non-forgeborn, rumors say
      that they take those critically wounded in combat and repair their bodies,
      wiping the new forgeborn's memories and giving new life to the
      otherwise-fallen. Some darker rumors say that the race has learned not
      only how to alter the living, but potentially the recently deceased, but
      there has been little proof of this.</p><p>Although they may appear as
      some sort of bizarre construct, the forgeborn are intelligent and capable
      of thought, emotion, and reasoning. While much of their time is spent
      working out combat strategies and ways to harness the psionic energy that
      powers their forms, they are avid students of history.</p><p>Forgeborn
      benefit from longer lifespans than the human bodies that most of them were
      made from, but their inclination for combat means many never actually
      reach middle age. Among the forgeborn, such a fate is not mourned, for the
      fallen can sometimes be reclaimed and rebuilt into a new member of the
      race, resulting in a theology very similar to
      reincarnation.</p><p><strong>Physical Description</strong>: Forgeborn are
      a tall and thick race, and stand a few inches taller than most humans,
      with their bodies flowing from well-muscled flesh to mineral components
      and back. The exact nature of the forgeborn's mineral varies between
      members of the race, from crystal, to steel, to darkwood, or even
      mithral.</p><p>All forgeborn have small glowing orbs embedded within their
      skull and chest, which are the psionic power source that animates their
      form. Although both male and female versions of forgeborn exist, such
      distinctions do not matter in forgeborn society, since there is no need
      for copulation. While most forgeborn come from human bodies, members from
      other races are not uncommon.</p><p><strong>Society</strong>: The origins
      of the forgeborn have led them to have a social structure not unlike an
      army, where forgeborn tend to cluster based upon role, rather than from a
      family or tribal structure. While the race tends to prefer combat over
      negotiations, they are not vicious nor aggressive; they view combat as the
      best means to victory, rather than as a desired activity. All members of
      forgeborn society are given a role to benefit the civilization, and skill
      in that role is what measures a forgeborn's worth among his peers. There
      is an aesthetic element to some forgeborn, particularly in artwork
      depicting great battles, so forgeborn artisans are respected within their
      society.</p><p><strong>Relations</strong>: Most races are uncomfortable
      with the unnatural form of the forgeborn, while the forgeborn view other
      races as inferior due to their reliance on sustenance and rest. Most
      members of the elan race, however, view the forgeborn as abominations that
      are a disgusting perversion of the elan transformation
      process.</p><p><strong>Alignment and Religion</strong>: Forgeborn view
      victory as the most important outcome and put no stock in honor. They
      fight to win, not to be honorable, although they do accept surrender. The
      structure of command is integral to the proper functioning of an army, so
      few forgeborn go against the defined chain of command. Most forgeborn are
      lawful neutral.</p><p><strong>Adventurers</strong>: Those forgeborn who
      choose to visit new lands are often seeking to find new potential recruits
      for the ranks or want to study new combat tactics and the war histories of
      other nations. With little in the way of familial ties, few forgeborn get
      homesick, but feel an urge to return to share new
      information.</p><p><strong>Names</strong>: Because forgeborn are built
      from members of other races, the names of forgeborn are varied and do not
      have common traditional names. Forgeborn names are drawn from any of the
      cultures around them.</p>
