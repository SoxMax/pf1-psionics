  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The physical stature of half-giants lets them function in many ways as
      if they were one size category larger. Whenever a half-giant is subject to
      a size modifier or special size modifier for a Combat Maneuver Bonus or
      Combat Maneuver Defense (such as during grapple checks, bull rush
      attempts, and trip attempts), the half-giant is treated as one size larger
      if doing so is advantageous to him. A half-giant is also considered to be
      one size larger when determining whether a creature’s special attacks
      based on size (such as grab or swallow whole) can affect him. A half-giant
      can use weapons designed for a creature one size larger without penalty.
      However, his space and reach remain those of a creature of his actual
      size. The benefts of this racial trait stack with the effects of powers,
      abilities, and spells that change the subject’s size category.</p>
