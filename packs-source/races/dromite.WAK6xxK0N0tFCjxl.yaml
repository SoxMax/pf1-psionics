      <p>Small and insectoid in appearance, dromites stand out in most crowds of
      humanoids. Their antennae, faceted eyes, carapace, and small stature make
      them visibly different from most. Hailing from a hivemind-like history,
      dromites have come to love and appreciate individuality while still
      continuing to live in a hive and collective environment. This
      individuality, together with a strong liberal view on life, means that
      while different, dromites rarely have a problem making friends or finding
      a place to live or work.</p><p><strong>Physical Description:</strong>
      Around the height of gnomes and halflings, dromites stand between 3 and 4
      feet tall, but tend to be sturdier in nature. Dromites have a natural
      resistance towards the energy of their caste granted by the chitin that
      covers parts of their body. The caste of a dromite is easily recognized by
      the coloration of the carapace: red for Fire Caste, pale blue for Ice
      Caste, white for Voice Caste, and green for Glimmer Caste. The skin of the
      dromite not covered by chitin ranges from a pale white to a dark tan.
      Dromites have faceted eyes which often shine with a psionic energy, and
      large antennae that constantly quiver. Their small mouths are devoid of
      external mandibles, but when eating, small internal mandibles are used to
      help eat. Dromites have three fingers and a thumb, each covered in a
      pointed carapace, with the same for their four toes. This gives the
      dromites a look very different from other humanoids. Dromites are asexual,
      being neither female nor male, except in the case of the Hive Queen and
      Hive Consorts. In this situation, rituals are performed that grant gender
      and reproductive capabilities.</p><p><strong>Society:</strong> Most
      dromites organize themselves into hive cities – giant towers that are as
      much subterranean as they are exposed above ground. Here they embrace
      their caste as well as their individuality, striving to find their path in
      life. For some, this means striving to become a Hive Queen or Consort, the
      elected leaders of a hive, while for others it means learning a craft or
      toiling in a mine to make ends meet. While externally very idealistic, a
      society with very few laws and defining aspects also tends to become
      chaotic and disorganized. Most hive cities tend to walk the line between
      individual freedoms and communal responsibility. while there are a few
      zealots amongst the dromites who dream of a better time, when they were
      all united as one mind.</p><p><strong>Relations:</strong> The dromites get
      along splendidly with halflings and gnomesmost of all, and the jovial ways
      of both xephs and half-elves tends to put dromites at ease. The cold,
      distant, ways of ophiduans and maenads make the dromites curious, wishing
      to prod and experiment with them, to find out the reasons for their
      demeanors. Most other races are viewed by their individual means, but most
      dromites find the dwarves to be dull, boring and when drunk – gruff and
      coarse.</p><p><strong>Alignment and Religion:</strong> Most dromites are
      religiously indiscriminate, finding grace and faith in a number of gods,
      sometimes part of the same pantheon, sometimes creating their own mixes of
      gods and faiths. Dromites tend toward no particular alignment, not even
      neutral. The best and the worst are found among them.</p><p><strong>A Note
      on Names:</strong> Dromites have no gender, and thus their names are not
      divided between male and female. Generally, a dromite has a personal name,
      a caste name, and a homestead name – typically a hive
      city.</p><p><strong>Personal Names:</strong> Niks, Rask, Sask, Neksak,
      Leksa, Heneks, Seleks, Seksa, Aksa, Olak, Leik, Svek,
      Hakkor.</p><p><strong>Caste Names:</strong> Fire, Glimmer, Ice, Shatter,
      Thunder, Flash, Lightning, Sunspark, Icespear, Stormstrike.</p>
