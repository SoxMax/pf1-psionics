      <p>Far back in their ancient history, half-giants were slaves to some form
      of king. Their stories vary from tribe to tribe, but their former status
      as slaves is one thread that is common in the lore of every half-giant
      tribe. As slaves, they fought their oppressors and earned their freedom.
      As a result, nothing is more important to half-giants than their liberty.
      They will fight and even kill to stay free, and few things are capable of
      breaking a half-giants will to live like slavery. Indeed, most half-giants
      would prefer to commit suicide rather than face incarceration or
      enslavement. For these reasons, most half-giants tend to be law-abiding
      and respectful, but they can have a tendency to solve problems by
      resorting to violence rather than risk being apprehended. Some myths claim
      that they were spawned from fire giants, while others say that they worked
      in volcanic forges. Regardless of the truth, half-giants are more
      resilient to heat, a trait that serves them well in the present, as they
      have a tendency to dwell in arid lands and deserts.</p><p><strong>Physical
      Description:</strong> Standing over eight feet tall, half-giants are the
      largest of the common races, towering above even half-orcs, with males
      slightly taller and heavier than females. Their size makes them imposing
      but slow to react. Their skin ranges from nearly complete black to a deep
      tan, while their hair is almost always black. Their eyes typically range
      from blue to green, but a fair number have red eyes, making them stand out
      against other races. Most half-giants tend to wear little clothing, or
      very heavy armor, depending on the situation; in a social gathering, their
      tribal clothing covers very little to account for their tendency to reside
      in hot lands, and most half-giants are proud of their bodies and physical
      looks and prowess. In combat, they prefer to wear heavy armor, taking
      advantage of their natural strength and
      stature.</p><p><strong>Society:</strong> Half-giants most commonly
      organize themselves into nomadic and shifting tribes, following
      charismatic and wise leaders for brief periods. Many half-giants have a
      tendency to drift into and out of tribes over time, while a portion of a
      tribe may split out and start a new tribe, which may later merge with a
      larger tribe. When enemies gather, empires rise, or war looms, the
      half-giant tribes might unite under their strongest and wisest leaders,
      protecting each other from the threat of oppression. In times of peace,
      they splinter into hundreds of individual tribes, enjoying the freedom
      they hold so dear. As societies go, the half-giants are generally composed
      of nomadic hunters, taking down the giant sandworms of the desert or
      hunting elephants across the savannah and plains. Half-giants enjoy
      dancing, drinking and games of physical prowess such as wrestling,
      running, and spear throwing.</p><p><strong>Relations:</strong> Half-giants
      appreciate the open nature of humans and half-elves and can sympathize
      with how half-orcs sometimes feel outside of society. Elves with their
      slow pace, dwarves and maenads with their rigid societies, and ophiduans
      with their expansionist behavior generally make the half-giants
      uncomfortable. Most of the other races are welcomed based on their
      behavior, although the carelessness of halflings, dromites, and gnomes
      worry the half-giants, who believe that it will lead to these smaller
      races being taken advantage of and, therefore, possible subservience and
      slavery. Half-giants keep duergars at arms length due to the use of
      slavery.</p><p><strong>Alignment and Religion:</strong> Worshiping gods
      relating to freedom, nature, summer, and the hunt, half-giants are devout
      but very naturalistic. They manifest their worship with totem poles,
      believing the gods to be pleased with depictions of their power, thus
      protecting the tribe from evil. Most half-giants tend to be neutral or
      chaotic good, striving to help both the tribe and others as well as they
      can, although their belief in following the law to avoid incarceration can
      result in lawful half-giants. This does not mean that a half-giant wont
      resort to violence at the slightest sign of evil. Indeed, to most
      half-giants, jail, incarceration, and slavery are all seen as equally evil
      and to be fought to the last breath.</p><p><strong>Adventurers:</strong>
      Most half-giants are driven into adventuring by wanderlust and a wish to
      learn more about the world around them. Some are driven by religious
      conviction, while others understand that they will help their tribe the
      most by making the world a safer place. Very few adventure to make money,
      greed is a strange concept to most half-giants.</p><p><strong>Male
