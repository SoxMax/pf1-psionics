      <p>The norals are a race of humanoids with a symbiotic bond with the
      erliss, a small psionic creature also referred to as a dreamscar. Norals
      that have bonded with an erliss no longer dream, giving the creature its
      nickname, as well as giving the bonded norals the nickname of the
      dreamscarred. The symbiotic joining process has left the noral race open
      to the benefit of other creatures on their society, making them more
      likely to seek out information on other cultures and talented at social
      interactions.</p><p>Known for being physically clumsier than most, some
      surmise that norals lack agility because the bonding process has impacted
      their natural reflexes. Others argue it is because the race has a
      naturally stocky frame that simply does not lend itself well to precise
      movements. Despite this, the natural resiliency of their mental and
      physical forms has helped them overcome what is otherwise a liability for
      surviving the harsh lands near their settlements. However, their ability
      to block such assaults, combined with their natural ability to assault the
      minds of others, has given some a fear of the race as a potential
      subjugator of free will, a notion the norals find ludicrous for their
      views on free will as something to be nurtured and never to be
      threatened.</p><p>While some norals choose not to bond with an erliss,
      this is the exception, rather than the rule. The bonding process itself is
      done as a ceremony once a noral has reached adulthood and is considered an
      important step in the maturation of their younger generations. This
      ceremony is typically done in private, usually with only the noral’s
      parents in attendance. Upon completion, the newly-dreamscarred noral is
      considered an adult and afforded all privileges as
      such.</p><p><strong>Physical Description</strong>: Norals stand about as
      tall as humans, but are typically stockier in form. They have skin tones,
      eye color, and hair pigments of a similar range as humans, but a noral who
      has undergone the bonding process to become dreamscarred loses all skin
      and hair pigmentation, becoming an albino with pure white hair. A
      dreamscarred noral’s eyes turn pure black, and the erliss at the base of
      their neck rapidly grows into its mature form, with four tentacles coming
      out of the base of the noral’s neck, usually draping over the noral’s
      shoulders. In addition, a dreamscarred noral’s forehead and skull takes on
      a ridged and plated look, rather than the typical humanoid appearance. The
      erliss is a tentacled creature that looks something like a sea star, with
      four or five arms that stretch out from the central core. Most often
      white, pale pink, pale blue, the erliss can exist comfortably in both
      water and on land. The small ridges across their appendages can quickly
      change color, which is often used to scare away lesser predators. On the
      underside of the creature, there is a small mouth. One of the tentacles
      has a small reddish opening that can extrude the romon, a slithering
      tentacle used to collect food, paralyze prey and, perhaps most
      importantly, initiate the psychic bridge that begins the melding process.
      The bonding is initiated by placing the erliss on the noral’s neck, with
      its mouth flush against the exposed skin of the noral, and the tentacle
      placed at the base of the skull.</p><p><strong>Society</strong>: The
      societal structure of the norals is one of a democratic republic. In their
      society, only norals who have gone through the bonding process may vote
      for the Ruling Council, which then governs. Unbonded norals do not get to
      vote, as they are seen as still being children or outcasts, causing most
      young norals to seek to complete the bonding ritual or to leave for lands
      where such a distinction does not matter. The resistance that norals have
      against mental intrusion gives them a strong sense of morality when it
      comes to the use of compulsions or domination – be it mental or physical.
      This leads few to seek the use of such tactics, although those who work as
      mediators push the envelope by using powers that only read thoughts,
      arguing that since they are not compelling the subject, it is simply a
      better way to achieve amicable solutions, while their natural ability to
      attack the minds of others is viewed as a to be used only in self-defense
      and never as a means to impose their
      will.</p><p><strong>Relations</strong>: The benefits the noral race derive
      from the erliss make them naturally inclined to seek out new cultures that
      might grant them improvements to their own. Their natural inclination to
      understand other cultures and to easily interact with other races has
      helped them to take on a role of mediator for conflicts, while they try to
      maintain neutrality. When such attempts are unsuccessful, or when the
      norals are cast as favoring one side over another, the norals will instead
      withdraw and allow the other races to resolve matters on their own, even
      if it results in brutal combat.</p><p>Among the other races, the norals
      have the most difficulty working with the psionocratic ophiduan race, for
      they see the serpentine race’s ruling style as barbarism wrapped in a
      supposed enlightened form of government. In addition, some cultures, such
      as dwarves, view the norals’ preference to stay out of conflicts as
      passively condoning the actions of their enemies, earning enmity on more
      than one occasion. One area where norals dislike the interactions with
      other races is in the proclivity of other races to kiss in public. Kissing
      for the norals is their means to breed more erliss, so they view such
      public displays as unseemly.</p><p><strong>Alignment and
      Religion</strong>: Norals worship a pantheon of deities which reflect the
      many facets of daily life. While they have the full spectrum of alignments
      within their society, the general tendency of the race is toward lawful
      over chaotic, as the structure of the society and the bonding process and
      the responsibility of breeding the erliss leads most norals to respect the
      rule of law and the needs for organized social
      structure.</p><p><strong>Adventurers</strong>: Norals who adventure are
      often those seeking the perceived glory of combat heard of from the other
      cultures they work with, or to rise in the view of society. Worldly
      experience, especially with other races, is prized within noral society
      for those seeking leadership roles. Conversely, others might go off on
      adventures to get away from the structure of noral
      society.</p><p><strong>Male Names</strong>: Merixal, Deridal, Codinal,
