  description:
    value: |-
      <p><b>Ranged specialist:</b> At 19th level, a Marksman's ranged and thrown attacks have their critical multiplier increased by 1 (x2 becomes x3, for example) and her penalties for range increments are halved. If the Marksman has the Far Shot feat, she instead suffers no penalties for range increments.
