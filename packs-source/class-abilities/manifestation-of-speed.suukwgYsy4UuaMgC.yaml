  description:
    value: |-
      <p><b>manifestation of speed:</b> At 2nd level, a voyager gains the ability to combine her kinetic and psionic energy into special types of attacks called augmented attacks. Making an augmented attack is a standard action and is made like a normal attack with a weapon, but is prefaced by the expenditure of points of momentum, power points, or both.
