  description:
    value: |-
      <p><b>Evade arrows:</b> At 2nd level, a Marksman's familiarity with ranged attacks and her natural intuition alerts her to danger from mundane ranged attacks. She gains a +1 Dodge bonus to Armor Class against ranged attacks (but not ranged touch attacks). At 6th level and every four Marksman levels thereafter, this Dodge bonus increases by 1.
