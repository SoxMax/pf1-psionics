  description:
    value: |-
      <p><b>eternal warrior:</b> At 20th level, once per day as a free action, the psychic warrior can enter into a very powerful trance. As long as he maintains psionic focus, for up to 5 minutes the psychic warrior adds his Wisdom modifier to his attack rolls, damage rolls, AC, skill checks, ability checks, saves, and initiative, and he increases his speed by +5 feet for every point of his Wisdom modifier. These benefits stack with those that might be granted by his active path's trance (or both paths, if using pathweaving).
