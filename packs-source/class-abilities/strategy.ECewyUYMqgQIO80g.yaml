  description:
    value: |-
      <p><b>Strategy:</b> At 4th level, and every three tactician levels thereafter, a tactician learns a new tactical strategy, granting him special abilities in combat. Unless specified otherwise, using a strategy is a swift action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Strategies are often orders or suggestions that the tactician issues to members of his collective. A tactician may not direct a strategy at himself unless a strategy specifies otherwise.
