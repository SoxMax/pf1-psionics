  description:
    value: |-
      <p><b>Steal life:</b> Beginning at 14th level, a vitalist can not only steal the health of a target, but steal their life itself. By making a successful melee touch attack and expending psionic focus, the vitalist can force the target to make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + half class level + Wisdom modifier) or die. A successful save negates this effect. Targets with more than 140 hit points are unaffected by this ability.
