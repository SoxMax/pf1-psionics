  description:
    value: |-
      <p><b>lifeblood siphon:</b> At 6th level, a highlord can siphon mental energy from the members of his collective, drawing on their goals and desires that they and he share. Whenever the highlord manifests a power, he may also designate another member of his collective to drain energy from. That member of the collective takes damage equal to the number of power points used on the power and becomes staggered until the highlord's next turn. In addition, the highlord regains half the total power points he spent on the power. The target can resist the staggering effect and deny the highlord the regained power points by succeeding at a Fortitude save (DC 10 + the power points that would be refunded + the highlord's Charisma modifier). This ability can only be used once per round, even if the highlord manifests multiple powers during that round.
