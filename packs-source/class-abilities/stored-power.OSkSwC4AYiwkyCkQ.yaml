  description:
    value: |-
      <p><b>Stored power:</b> At 4th level, a voyager's mind gathers and stores excess psionic power from her parallel timelines. She gains a second pool of power points that she can draw upon when she would normally spend power points. This second pool can contain a maximum amount of power points in this way equal to 1/3 of her normal maximum power points from voyager levels (including bonus power points from her Intelligence). Power points from the voyager's stored power pool are treated as part of her normal pool for the purposes of manifesting powers; she may pay power costs partially with stored power and partially with normal power points, if she wishes. Whenever the voyager regains power points after a night's rest, this secondary pool of power refills as well.
