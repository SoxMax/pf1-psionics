  description:
    value: |-
      <p><b>Improved evasion:</b> At 12th level, a voyager's evasion improves. While the voyager still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, she takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless voyager does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.
