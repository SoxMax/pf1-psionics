  description:
    value: |-
      <p>At 5th level, willingly or unwillingly, a highlord's charismatic and psionic nature bleeds into the environment around him. The highlord can establish a location as his territory, after spending at least a week in the area around it. This location must be an area no larger in volume than a cube that is a number of feet per side equal to 10 feet per highlord level. If it is a public (or at least well known) area, it becomes widely regarded by others that the highlord controls or own it in some way. The highlord's power influences the appearance of the area through his open heart ability, though objects within it are not changed as to become unrecognizable.
      </p><p>If another creature is already considered the controller or owner of the area, that creature and the highlord make opposed Charisma checks. The character who succeeds in this check is considered the owner or controller of the area the highlord designates, though the original owner is free to contest this claim by confronting the highlord directly. After establishing an area as his territory, the highlord must return to it at least once every three days to renew his claim upon it. Otherwise, the effect disappears and other creatures may become considered the owner or controller of the area, as normal.
      </p><p>The highlord can also channel this power into one of his subjects. As a full-round action, the highlord can designate a willing member of his collective to bear his mark. As a result, that creature remains within the collective and can communicate with the highlord through telepathy, even if they were to leave the collective's normal range. As long as the creature is designated by the highlord's mark, the highlord can communicate through that creature and use Charisma based skills as if he were occupying that creature's space, using his skill ranks and bonuses in place of the marked creature.
      </p><p>These marks can be dismissed as a free action. The highlord can only mark a single location or creature at a time. Affecting a location or a creature with his mark means he is unable to use this ability until he dismisses the first mark.
      </p><p>At 8th level, the highlord can maintain a mark on both a location and a creature at the same time. His followers also grow more vigilant in their defense of the highlord's territory. Members of the collective within the area of a marked location gain a +3 bonus to Perception, and creatures marked by the highlord gain a +3 bonus to Sense Motive.
      </p><p>At 14th level, while within areas the highlord controls, the highlord and his allies within the collective gain a +2 morale bonus to attack rolls and saves, and the DC to resist being forced into the collective increases by 2. In addition, the highlord can use his powers and class abilities from creatures that he has marked, treating the range and effects of such effects as if he were the marked creature. Doing this requires the highlord and the creature he has marked to use the same action required to manifest the power or use the ability.
      </p><p>At 18th level, the highlord can maintain a number of marks equal to his Charisma modifier (minimum 1) at the same time. These marks can be on any combination of locations and creatures.
