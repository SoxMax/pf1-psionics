      <p>At 1st level, the highlord gains a decree based on his chosen tenet, granting him a special command he can issue. At 4th level and every three levels afterwards, a highlord learns an additional highlord decree.
      </p><p>In order to use a decree, the highlord must expend his psionic focus. He cannot regain that psionic focus until the decree ends (either by its duration running out or the highlord dismissing it).
      </p><p>When a decree's duration runs its course, the highlord recovers the psionic focus he spent to use the decree. In any round after the one he activated the decree in, the highlord can dismiss its effect as a move action, regaining the psionic focus he expended to use it. If the highlord possesses the <a href="/wiki/Psionic_Meditation" title="Psionic Meditation">Psionic Meditation</a> feat, he can instead dismiss decrees as swift actions. A highlord who has multiple psionic focuses (such as through the <a href="/wiki/Psicrystal_Containment" title="Psicrystal Containment">Psicrystal Containment</a> feat) can have multiple active decrees at once—one for each psionic focus.
      </p><p>Unless specifically noted, decrees are mind-affecting effects, and if a member of the highlord's collective is unwilling to be affected by one of his decrees (such as if it applies a negative condition, or directs them to take actions they're unwilling to take), the collective member can make a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the highlord's class level + the highlord's Charisma modifier) to resist the effect of the decree. This means that they forgo any actions that may have been granted and they ignore any benefits or conditions that may have been applied. A creature willing to be affected by a decree can voluntarily accept it; if they do, it ignores any immunity to mind-affecting effects they might possess. A highlord can take the Ability Focus (decrees) feat, in which case it affects the DC of saving throws made against any of the decrees the highlord uses.
