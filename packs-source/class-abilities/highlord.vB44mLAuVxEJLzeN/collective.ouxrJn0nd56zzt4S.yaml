  description:
    value: |-
      <p>A highlord learns to use psionic power to connect willing minds through an internal network that strengthens their psychic bonds. As a standard action, a highlord can join any number of willing targets into his collective (up to his limit, see below). The highlord must have line of sight to each target, each target must have a Wisdom score of at least 1, and all targets must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per class level). The collective can contain up to his Charisma modifier or half his highlord level, whichever is higher. The highlord is always considered a member of his own collective, and does not count against this limit.
      </p><p>The highlord can choose to remove a member as a free action on his turn, and any member can voluntarily leave the collective as a free action on their turn. Any member whose Wisdom drops to zero or who moves out of range of the collective is automatically removed. If a member enters a null psionics field, the connection to the collective is suppressed until the member leaves the field. A member who leaves the collective for any reason immediately loses any and all benefits they may have gained from being a member. A highlord is aware of the status of his collective and can, roughly, sense the presence of each member, although beyond telling if such a creature is still a member, this has no mechanical benefit until higher levels (see telepathy below).
      </p><p>A highlord can manifest certain powers through his collective. If a highlord power specifies one or more willing targets (or is harmless) and has a range greater than personal, he can manifest this power on a member of his collective regardless of the range of the actual power. All other non-range restrictions still apply. He may manifest any power with the Network Descriptor this way, regardless of their actual ranges or targets. If he is capable of manifesting powers or casting spells from a different class (as is the case for a multiclass highlord), any compatible spell or power with a range greater than touch can also be used through the collective.
      </p><p>If a member of the collective dies, the member is removed from the collective and the highlord must make a Fortitude save (DC 15) or lose 1 power point for every Hit Die of the fallen member and be sickened for an equal number of rounds.
      </p><p>At 15th level, a highlord's collective range is limitless on the same plane as the highlord.
      </p><p>At 19th level, a highlord's range reaches even across other planes and dimensions.
