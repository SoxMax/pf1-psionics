  description:
    value: |-
      <p><b>Path skill:</b> At 4th level, the psychic warrior gains a +2 bonus to one skill associated with a path he is on. Every three levels thereafter, he can choose to increase the bonus to one of his path skills by +2 (to a maximum of +6 for any one path skill). This may be a skill he has already chosen or a new skill associated with a path he is on.
