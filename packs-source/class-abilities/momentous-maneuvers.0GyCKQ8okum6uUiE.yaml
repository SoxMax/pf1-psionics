  description:
    value: |-
      <p><b>momentous maneuvers:</b> At 5th level, the voyager can use her momentum for more than just direct damage, channeling it to enhance her tactical maneuvers. When she makes a combat maneuver check, she can expend momentum to augment her action and avoid provoking attacks of opportunity with the maneuver. She gains a +2 bonus on the combat maneuver roll for each point of momentum spent. The maximum bonus granted by this ability is 2 + 1/2 her voyager level.
