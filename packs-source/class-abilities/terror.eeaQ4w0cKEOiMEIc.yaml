  description:
    value: |-
      <p><b>terror:</b> Beginning at 2nd level, a dread learns to harness the power of fear in a variety of ways called terrors. Using a terror is a swift action. Some terrors are channelled through her devastating touch class feature. These terrors charge a dread's touch (and later her weapon) until her next successful attack that round.
