  description:
    value: |-
      <p><b>coordinated strike:</b> The tacician is able to direct his allies to coordinating their attacks upon a single target to devastating effect. As a swift action, the tactician can declare one target within his line of sight as the primary foe. All members of the tactician's collective, including the tactician himself gain a +1 insight bonus to attacks against the primary foe until the beginning of the tactician's next turn. At 5th level and every four levels thereafter, this bonus increases by 1.
