  description:
    value: |-
      <p><b>Echo effect:</b> At 8th level, the tactician gains the ability to copy non-permanent magical and psionic effects within his collective. If a member of the collective is affected by a magical or psionic effect with a duration greater than 1 round, the tactician can echo it onto another member of his collective. To do so the tactician must first identify the power properly (see the Spellcraft skill description).
