  description:
    value: |-
      <p>A wilder can channel her wild surge into a blast of uncontrolled phrenic energy. As a standard action and by expending psionic focus, the wilder can make a ranged touch attack (range 30') that deals 1d6 points of force damage for every +1 to her wild surge.
      </p><p><i>Example</i>: Amonai, a 15th level wilder has wild surge +5, and thus deals 5d6 with his surge blast. Surge blasts do not trigger psychic enervation.
