  description:
    value: |-
      <p>The wilder has mastered the untamable and can now use a blindingly powerful version of wild surge, albeit at great cost. Once per day, the wilder may add +10 to her manifester level on one manifestation as if through wild surge. In addition to this increase, the manifestation also receives +3 to its save DC, +3 to any attack rolls involved, and is treated as a power five levels higher for the purposes of level-dependent effects (such as <i>minor globe of invulnerability</i>). A power manifested with a perfect surge has the radius and intensity of its associated displays doubled; such displays cannot be hidden normally. The wilder exudes light as if she is the subject of the <i>daylight</i> spell while using a perfect surge, and anyone who makes physical contact with her before the start of her next turn takes 1d4 points of fire damage. However, this extreme example of wild surging has its price. The wilder is struck by psychic enervation afterwards without fail, except she suffers her associated condition (dazed, staggered, etc.) for 1d4 rounds and loses a number of power points or hit points (dependent on path) equal to her manifester level +10. The wilder also takes 2 points of ability burn to every ability score.
      </p><p>The wilder cannot use wild surge or Overchannel on the same manifestation as a perfect surge.
