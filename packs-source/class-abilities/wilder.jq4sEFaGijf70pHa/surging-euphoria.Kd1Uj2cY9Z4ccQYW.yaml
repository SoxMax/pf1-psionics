    value: |-
      <p>Starting at 4th level, when a wilder uses her wild surge ability, she gains a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws for a number of rounds equal to the intensity of her wild surge. If a wilder is overcome by psychic enervation following her wild surge, she does not gain the morale bonus for this use of her wild surge ability.
      </p><p>At 12th level, the morale bonus on a wilder's attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws increases to +2. At 20th level, the bonus increases to +3.
