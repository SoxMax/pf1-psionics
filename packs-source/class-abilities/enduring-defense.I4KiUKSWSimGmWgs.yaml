  description:
    value: |-
      <p><b>Enduring defense:</b> A cryptic of 14th level can choose any option from the altered defense ability and always be under that effect. The cryptic can still change the effect as a swift action, but she is no longer limited to how many rounds per day she can have Altered Defense active.
