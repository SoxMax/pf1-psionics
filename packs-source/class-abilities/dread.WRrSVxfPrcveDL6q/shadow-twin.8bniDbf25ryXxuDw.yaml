  description:
    value: |-
      <p>A dread of 11th level is able to draw forth a replica of herself formed from fears and nightmares. The shadow twin appears at a location chosen by the dread that is within 30 ft. and lasts for one round per class level. The dread and this shadow twin are, for all intents and purposes, one person - including only having one round's worth of actions to use between the two, sharing attacks of opportunity, sharing a single pool of hit points and power points, and having access to all of the same abilities and daily uses of those abilities. If the shadow twin is damaged or healed, the dread takes the damage or healing, and vice versa. If both the dread and the shadow twin are affected by the same area of effect, damage is only counted once.
      </p><p>If the shadow twin attacks, it uses the dread's attack values. The shadow twin can threaten squares and has all the same equipment as the dread, but charged items or items with limited uses per day have their uses shared between the two. Any permanent magic items are also active on the shadow twin.
      </p><p>The shadow twin can allow the dread to flank an enemy, make attacks of opportunity she wouldn't normally be able to do, extend the range for a power or mindlock, or just scout ahead.
      </p><p>Effects, both beneficial and detrimental, that affect the dread also affect the shadow twin, and vice versa. The shadow twin must stay within 30 ft. of the dread or the effect immediately ends.
      </p><p>A dread can use shadow twin a number of times per day equal to his Charisma modifier.
      </p><p>At 15th level, the shadow twin must stay within 100 ft. of the dread before the effect ends.
      </p><p>At 19th level, the shadow twin must stay within 400 ft. of the dread before the effect ends.
