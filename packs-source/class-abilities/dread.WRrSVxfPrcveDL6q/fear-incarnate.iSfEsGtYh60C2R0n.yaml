    value: |-
      <p>At 20th level the dread no longer acts as a simple conduit between the realm of nightmares and the Material Plane, but becomes the embodiment of nightmares. The dread's type changes to Outsider (native), she gains DR 10/psionic, and she gains the ability to turn ethereal at will. In addition, the dread can use the Nightmare Form terror at will, even if she does not already have it. Using Nightmare Form no longer consumes a use of her terrors for the day.
