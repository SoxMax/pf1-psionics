  description:
    value: |-
      <p>Beginning at 2nd level, a dread learns to harness the power of fear in a variety of ways called terrors. Using a terror is a swift action. Some terrors are channelled through her devastating touch class feature. These terrors charge a dread's touch (and later her weapon) until her next successful attack that round.
      </p><p>Some terrors can be augmented by spending power points, similar to manifesting powers, to increase their effect. When augmenting her terrors with power points, the dread cannot spend more power points than her manifester level on any single use of a terror.
      </p><p>A dread can use her terrors a total number of times per day equal to her dread level + her Charisma modifier.
      </p><p>All terrors may only be chosen once unless otherwise specified.
