  description:
    value: |-
      <p>At 6th level, and every six levels thereafter, the tactician gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as <a href="/wiki/Teamwork_feat" title="Teamwork feat">teamwork feats</a>. The tactician must meet the prerequisites of the selected bonus feat.
      </p><p>By spending one hour in meditation, the tactician can change anyone teamwork feat he has already learned for another teamwork feat whose prerequisites he meets. In effect, the tactician loses the bonus feat in exchange for a new one.
