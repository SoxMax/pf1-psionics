  description:
    value: |-
      <p>When a tactician reaches 3rd level, all willing members of his collective (including the tactician himself) can communicate with each other telepathically, even if they do not share a common language. Psionic creatures who are willing members in a tactician's collective (including the tactician himself) may manifest unknown powers known by another willing psionic creature in the collective as if they were making physical contact.
