      - Tactician
  description:
    value: |-
      <p>At 8th level, the tactician gains the ability to copy non-permanent magical and psionic effects within his collective. If a member of the collective is affected by a magical or psionic effect with a duration greater than 1 round, the tactician can echo it onto another member of his collective. To do so the tactician must first identify the power properly (see the Spellcraft skill description).
      </p><p>Echoing a magical or psionic effect is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity and costs the tactician a number of power points equal to the original effect's caster or manifester level (whichever applies). As a supernatural ability, a tactician is permitted to spend more power points than his manifest level on this effect. The new target must be legal for the effect in question (for instance, if you attempt to echo an unaugmented Empathic Connection on a dog, the echo will fail). If the effect allows a saving throw, the new target is entitled to a saving throwwhen the effect is echoed (same DC as the original power).
      </p><p>Only the basic effect and augmentation are echoed: metamagic and metapsionic feats do not echo. The echo has all the same decisions made as the original. For example, Specified Energy Adaption echoes would guard against the same energy type, while a 5pp Empathic Connection (extended duration) could not be echoed as a 5pp Empathic Connection (affects aberrations). The echo takes effect at the same caster or manifester level as the originator. When the original ends or leaves the collective, all echoes of it also end. An echo can be dispelled as normal without terminating the original.
      </p><p>A tactician can spend power points to augment this supernatural ability. For every 4 additional power points spent, the echo may reach an additional target. If the augment would raise the cost of the echo above the tactician's manifester level, the echo attempt fail (although he may still attempt to echo it onto a single target). The tactician knows if an effect is beyond his ability to echo this way when he identifies it.
