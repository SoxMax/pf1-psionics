    value: |-
      <p>At 1st level, cryptics receive <a href="/wiki/Scribe_Tattoo" title="Scribe Tattoo">Scribe Tattoo</a> as a bonus feat. A cryptic can scribe tattoos of any power she knows (up to 3rd level). The power must be one that can be made into a tattoo. The cryptic does not need to meet the prerequisites for this feat.
