  description:
    value: |-
      <p>At 3rd level and every two levels thereafter, the cryptic's disrupt pattern deals an additional 1d6 points of damage. This additional damage is not multiplied on a critical hit or by using feats such as Vital Strike, but it is halved if the creature struck is not of the cryptic's active creature type.
