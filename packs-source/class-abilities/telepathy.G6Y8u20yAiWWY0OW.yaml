  description:
    value: |-
      <p><b>telepathy:</b> When a highlord reaches 3rd level, all willing members of his collective (including the highlord himself) can communicate with each other telepathically, even if they do not share a common language. Psionic creatures who are willing members in a highlord's collective (including the highlord himself) may manifest unknown powers known by another willing psionic creature in the collective as if they were making physical contact.
