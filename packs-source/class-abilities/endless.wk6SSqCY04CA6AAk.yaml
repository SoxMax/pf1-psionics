      <p><b>Endless:</b> At 11th level, a voyager can continue their exploration of time for as long as she desires. A voyager ceases to age, though she may begin aging normally if she wishes to. This is a decision that the voyager can change at any time. The voyager cannot be magically aged, unless she allows it.
