  description:
    value: |-
      <p>A voyager generates kinetic energy that amplifies her dodging ability, but can also be channeled into an attack. Whenever the voyager moves, she generates 1 point of momentum for every 10 feet she moved. If the voyager teleports, she can treat the distance between her origin and arrival points as distance moved for the purposes of this effect. Effects that move or teleport the voyager unwillingly, such as a bull rush or a hostile teleport effect do not cause the voyager to generate momentum.
      </p><p>The maximum amount of momentum a voyager can have at once is equal to her class level, no matter how far she moves. A voyager gains a +1 dodge bonus to her AC and Reflex saves for each point of momentum she currently has, up to a maximum bonus equal to her Intelligence modifier (minimum +1). When the voyager makes an attack against a single target, she can spend points of momentum to deal an additional 1d6 points of damage per point consumed. On any attack that the voyager spent at least 1 point of momentum on, she gains a +2 bonus on her attack roll (even if momentum was spent in other ways, such as powering an augmented attack).
      </p><p>Momentum is not entirely retained from round to round—a voyager loses half of her gathered points of momentum at the start of each of her turns.
