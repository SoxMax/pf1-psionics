  description:
    value: |-
      <p>At 6th level, a voyager can begin to make contact with her other selves to exchange knowledge, gaining insight into a subject that another version of herself is an expert on. The voyager gains a bonus equal to half her class level on checks with a Knowledge skill of her choice, and can make checks with that Knowledge skill untrained. As a full-round action, the voyager can search her timeline in order to locate a version of herself knowledgeable in another aspect, allowing her to switch this bonus to a different Knowledge skill.
