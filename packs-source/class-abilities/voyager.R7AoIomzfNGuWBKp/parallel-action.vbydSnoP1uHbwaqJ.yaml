      <p>A voyager's aid from her parallel selves manifests through parallel actions that she knows. Parallel actions come in several categories, each with a listed level. When a voyager reaches the listed level, she chooses a specified number of parallel actions of the category of that level to learn. In addition, all voyagers learn the helping hand parallel action at 1st level for free.
      </p><p>The categories of parallel actions are as follows:
      </p>
      <ul><li><i>Combat Assistance (1st level):</i> The voyager learns two parallel actions that support her in a fight or in a relatively mundane way.</li>
      <li><i>Time Manipulation (3rd level):</i> The voyager learns two parallel actions that bend time to suit her needs.</li>
      <li><i>Manifesting Support (7th level):</i> The voyager learns two parallel actions that assist her when manifesting powers.</li>
      <li><i>Advanced Assistance (11th level):</i> The voyager learns one parallel action that influences the battlefield in unusual ways.</li>
      <li><i>Backup Plans (15th level):</i> The voyager learns one parallel action that serves to get her out of tight situations.</li>
      <li><i>Parallel Intrusion (19th level):</i> The voyager learns a parallel action that allows her to temporarily stop time and act as she wishes. Parallel actions are supernatural abilities that require the voyager's mental input to use, meaning if the voyager is under an effect that would impair her ability to think or remove her actions entirely (such as stunning or a <i>dominate person</i> spell), her parallel actions are likewise affected.</li></ul>
      <p>Using a parallel action does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Likewise, movement and teleportation made as part of a parallel action does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Unless otherwise noted, parallel actions that target something or teleport the voyager require line of sight, though those that teleport do not require line of effect.
      </p><p>Some of the voyager's parallel actions allow a save to resist their effects. The DC of saves against the voyager's parallel actions is DC 10 + 1/2 the voyager's class level + the voyager's Intelligence modifier). A voyager can take the Ability Focus (parallel action) feat, in which case it affects the DC of saving throws made against any of the parallel actions the voyager uses.
      </p><p>Parallel actions are unique abilities that can only be used on a voyager's parallel turn. A voyager's parallel turn is not a true turn, and a voyager can not take normal actions during it. A voyager can use one parallel action on her parallel initiative. Each parallel action lists a minimum voyager level required to use it, and the voyager must choose which parallel action or actions she learns at each given level.
      </p><p>Parallel actions that interact with creatures or objects within a certain range of the voyager can also be used on creatures or objects within that same range of her afterimage. For example, the helping hand parallel action allows the voyager to teleport an adjacent object to her. She can also teleport unattended objects that are adjacent to her afterimage.
