      <p>At 3rd level, the voyager gains some reach with her parallel actions beyond her body. Once per round, as a free action that can be taken at any point during her turn, the voyager can create an afterimage of herself occupying her space, that remains for as long as it is medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per class level) of herself. An afterimage does nothing by itself but denote the location its source occupied, and provide a vector for the voyager's parallel actions. Afterimages do not block creatures from passing through or occupying the space they occupy. The voyager can dismiss her afterimage as a free action. A voyager can only have one afterimage of herself at a time, and creating a new one causes older afterimages to disappear. Leaving the range of an afterimage also causes it to disappear.
      </p><p>Afterimages serve as an additional vector for the voyager's parallel actions, besides her own position. She can treat her afterimage's position as if it were her own for the purposes of determining her range with parallel actions. For example, this would allow her to use a parallel action that normally affects a creature adjacent to her, to affect a creature adjacent to her afterimage.
      </p><p>At the beginning of her parallel turn, the voyager can move her afterimage a distance up to 15 feet + 5 feet per 3 additional class levels past 3rd level. Her afterimage can move in any direction, and is not impaired by difficult terrain. However, it cannot pass through obstacles that the voyager could not pass through.
      </p><p>An afterimage usually resembles a ghostly form of the voyager (though due to her nature, they may appear different from herself). In all cases, afterimages are translucent and allow viewers to see through them, displaying their unreal nature like a disbelieved phantom or figment. If the voyager is currently using Stealth, she can have her afterimages do so as well, so long as they are in positions where they could hide. If she does, they use the same roll and result as the voyager's Stealth check.
