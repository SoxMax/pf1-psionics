      <p>At 2nd level, a voyager gains the ability to combine her kinetic and psionic energy into special types of attacks called augmented attacks. Making an augmented attack is a standard action and is made like a normal attack with a weapon, but is prefaced by the expenditure of points of momentum, power points, or both.
      </p><p>When making an augmented attack, the voyager first chooses how many points of momentum and power points she spends on augmented attack abilities, listed below. At this point, she also determines how many points of momentum she uses on the attack. The maximum combined total amount of power points and points of momentum spent on this ability (including the normal use of momentum) is equal to her manifester level.
      </p><p>Once this is decided, she then makes an attack with a weapon she is wielding, activating each applicable effect in the order specified by the ability. In addition to whatever effects she is paying for, the voyager can use the blink and dash abilities based on the power points and points of momentum spent on the augmented attack. Momentum is gained from the combined movement of these abilities after the augmented attack is made, meaning it cannot be used to enhance the attack or pay the augmented attack's other costs.
      </p>
      <ul><li><i>Blink:</i> When the voyager spends power points on an augmented attack, she can teleport up to 5 feet per power point spent, either before or after her attack. This teleportation must bring her to an unoccupied space she can see.</li>
      <li><i>Dash:</i> When the voyager spends points of momentum on an augmented attack (including from the normal use of momentum to enhance an attack's damage), she can move up to 5 feet per point of momentum spent, either before or after her attack. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity.</li></ul>
      <p>Each ability listed below can only be applied once per augmented attack, though some allow the voyager to spend additional power points or momentum to enhance the ability. Powers manifested as part of an augmented attack do not provoke attacks of opportunity, and powers learned through Expanded Knowledge count as voyager powers for the purposes of this ability.
      </p><p>In addition to enhancing her attack with momentum, the voyager can spend power points on her augmented attack in the following way:
      </p>
      <ul><li><i>Power Channel:</i> The voyager can bend time to attack and manifest a power at once. When making her augmented attack, she can manifest a voyager power (spending power points normally) with a manifesting time of 1 standard action or less. The power manifested must be either a personal power or a non-personal power that normally has a single target, including touch powers and rays. Powers with a variable number of targets (such as <i>energy missile</i>, or an <i>energy ray</i> with Split Psionic Ray) cannot be used with power channel. For powers targeting the voyager, the power can be manifested before or after her attack (allowing her to choose whether the power may affect the attack before it is delivered).
      <ul><li>For non-personal powers, the effect is channeled through her augmented attack. If her weapon attack hits, it applies the power's normal effect (if the power normally involves an attack roll and has effects on a miss, it will likewise apply them on a miss). If the weapon attack made as part of an augmented attack targets multiple creatures, the voyager chooses one target to affect with the power out of those that the attack hit.</li>
      <li>Powers that would normally apply to the voyager's next attack (such as sonic blast) can be manifested with power channel, applying their effects to the augmented attack. A critical hit with her weapon attack does not cause the power to also critical hit.</li></ul></li></ul>
      <p>At 5th level, the voyager adds the following abilities to her list of augmented attack options.
      </p>
      <ul><li><i>Maneuver Augmentation:</i> When the voyager makes an augmented attack, instead of making a weapon attack, she can attempt a combat maneuver that takes a standard action. If she expends momentum for this combat maneuver with Momentous Maneuvers (see below), it counts towards her augmented attack (contributing to dash and counting towards the limit of her manifester level). If she attempts to deliver a power through power channel with such an augmented attack, it applies the power's normal effect. If the power normally involves an attack roll, it will apply them if she succeeds on the combat maneuver attempt. If it has effects on a miss, it will apply them if she fails.</li></ul>
      <p>At 9th level, the voyager adds the following ability to her list of augmented attack options.
      </p>
      <ul><li><i>Multitask:</i> The voyager can manifest a voyager power (spending power points normally, though within the limits of manifestation of speed) with a manifesting time of 1 standard action or less, before or after her augmented attack. This may be any power she knows as a voyager; it need not target herself or the creature she is attacking, nor is it delivered through her weapon.</li></ul>
      <p>At 13th level, the voyager adds the following ability to her list of augmented attack options.
      </p>
      <ul><li><i>Speeding Strike:</i> The voyager can expend her psionic focus in addition to power points and points of momentum. If she does so, instead of making a normal augmented attack, she can teleport a distance equal to the distance she could have moved with blink and dash, and make an augmented attack that strikes at every creature directly between the start and end points of her teleportation. She makes one attack and damage roll, and uses these rolls against each target (momentum, if spent, applies damage to each target). The voyager takes a –2 penalty to damage on the attack for each target damaged by this attack beyond the first.
      <ul><li>When manifesting a power with a single target with power channel, the voyager chooses one creature out of the ones struck to affect with the power. However, when using this ability, the voyager can manifest a power that normally affects an area or multiple targets with power channel and apply its effects to every creature struck by this attack.</li></ul></li></ul>
      <p>Finally, at 17th level, the voyager adds the following ability to her list of augmented attack options.
      </p>
      <ul><li><i>Greater Multitask:</i> The voyager can manifest a voyager power (spending power points normally, though within the limits of manifestation of speed) with a manifesting time of 1 round or less, before or after her augmented attack. This may be any power she knows as a voyager; it need not target herself or the creature she is attacking, nor is it delivered through her weapon.</li></ul>
      <p>The voyager can potentially manifest multiple powers as part of her augmented attack (such as by using any combination of power channel, multitask, and greater multitask), but the combined costs are still limited by her manifester level, as noted above. If she uses Overchannel or a similar effect that would increase her manifester level for one of the powers, its benefits apply to all of them, as well as the ML bonus increases the total maximum spent on the augmented attack.
      </p>
      <table class="article-table">
      <tbody><tr>
      <td><b>Sample Augmented Attacks</b>
      <p>Within the limits of her manifester level, the voyager has a significant amount of flexibility with her use of manifestation of speed. She can mix manifestation, use of momentum, and movement to perform hit-and-run strikes with a unique flair.
      </p><p>For example, an 8th-level, melee-focused voyager could spend 5 points of momentum to enhance her attack, and 3 power points on <i>power channel</i>. This would allow her the following abilities:
      </p>
      <ul><li>25 feet of movement from <i>dash</i>.</li>
      <li>15 feet of teleportation from <i>blink</i>.</li>
      <li>A single weapon attack, taken at the same time as the power she manifested with <i>power channel</i>.</li></ul>
      <p>She can use these abilities in any order; for example, she could move 25 feet towards her target, make her attack and use her power, then teleport 15 feet away. Or she could do the inverse, teleporting to her target before moving away. She could even combine the teleportation and movement, to attack a target 40 feet away.
      </p><p>In each case, after the entire action and movement takes place, the voyager would regain 4 points of momentum.
