  description:
    value: |-
      <p>At 5th level, the voyager can use her momentum for more than just direct damage, channeling it to enhance her tactical maneuvers. When she makes a combat maneuver check, she can expend momentum to augment her action and avoid provoking attacks of opportunity with the maneuver. She gains a +2 bonus on the combat maneuver roll for each point of momentum spent. The maximum bonus granted by this ability is 2 + 1/2 her voyager level.
      </p><p>The voyager can also spend momentum on damaging applications of combat maneuvers, such as on a sunder attempt or the damage option in a grapple. This deals damage equal to the damage she could normally deal with momentum (normally 1d6 per point of momentum spent in this way).
      </p><p>The voyager is treated as having Dex 13, Int 13, Combat Expertise, and Improved Unarmed Strike for the purposes of meeting the prerequisites of improved combat maneuver feats or feats that require those improved combat maneuver feats as prerequisites.
