  description:
    value: |-
      <p>At 20th level, when a voyager dies, a future version of herself manifests to carry on her tasks. This does not happen if the voyager dies of old age. The future self appears in an unoccupied space within 50 feet of the present voyager's passing, and possess all of the voyager's statistics and abilities except for her swapped selves and eternity awaits class features. The voyager's magical items and equipment are transferred to her future self as she appears.The voyager's future self appears with maximum hit points, the same amount of power points as the voyager had when she passed, and 20 points of momentum that do not disappear at the start of her first turn. Should this future self die, their body vanishes and they cannot be raised from the dead.
      </p><p>The voyager's future self carries on with the voyager's tasks as she would have. After a night's rest, the future self is able to reverse the voyager's death and restore her body and soul to life. After doing so, she departs to her own time with a stern warning to her past self.
