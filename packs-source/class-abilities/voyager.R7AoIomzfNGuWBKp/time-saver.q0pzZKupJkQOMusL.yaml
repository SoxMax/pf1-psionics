      <p>At 7th level, whenever the voyager carries out a task, however boring it may be, an alternate self can pitch in to halve the time it takes. For the voyager, taking 20 on a given check is not considered to distract her for the purposes of Perception checks. In addition, the voyager halves the amount of time needed for taking 20 on skill checks, as well as the time taken on skill checks that that take a number of hours or days (excluding the skill checks for crafting magic and psionic items).
