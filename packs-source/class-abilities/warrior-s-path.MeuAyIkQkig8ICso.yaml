  description:
    value: |-
      <p><b>warrior's path:</b> At 1st level, a psychic warrior chooses a path to adhere to. When first taking a path, the psychic warrior gains one of the two powers associated with that path. Powers gained from a path do not count against his number of powers known. When manifesting this power, called a path power, the psychic warrior can either choose to manifest it for no cost by expending his psionic focus, in which case it cannot be augmented, or he can choose to manifest it normally, in which case his effective manifester level for this power is treated as one higher than normal.
