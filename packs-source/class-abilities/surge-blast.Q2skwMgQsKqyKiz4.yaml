  description:
    value: |-
      <p><b>surge blast:</b> A wilder can channel her wild surge into a blast of uncontrolled phrenic energy. As a standard action and by expending psionic focus, the wilder can make a ranged touch attack (range 30') that deals 1d6 points of force damage for every +1 to her wild surge.
