      <p><b>greater decrees:</b> At 10th level, and every three levels thereafter, a highlord can choose one of the following greater decrees in place of a decree. Some greater decrees require the expenditure of power points in order to be used. The highlord cannot spend more power points on a single decree at once than his manifester level. Unless stated otherwise, greater decrees are treated as decrees for the purposes of abilities and feats such as Ability Focus.
