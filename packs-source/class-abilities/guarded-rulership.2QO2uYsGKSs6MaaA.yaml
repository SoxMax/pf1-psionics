    value: |-
      <p><b>guarded rulership:</b> At 1st level, a highlord gains <a href="/wiki/Unwilling_Participant" title="Unwilling Participant">Unwilling Participant</a> as a bonus feat, except that its save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the highlord's manifester level + the highlord's Charisma modifier. When an unwilling member of the highlord's collective dies, the highlord does not need to make a save to avoid losing power points and being sickened.
