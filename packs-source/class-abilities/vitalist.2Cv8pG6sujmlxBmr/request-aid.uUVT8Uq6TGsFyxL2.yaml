  description:
    value: |-
      <p>Starting at 5th level, members of a vitalist's collective are able to request aid from the vitalist, should he not realize such aid is needed. As a standard action, any member of the collective can request healing from the vitalist. The vitalist can grant this request by spending up to his level in power points as a free action, even if it is not his turn. Each power point spent in this fashion heals 3 hit points to the target. A vitalist can even initiate this healing himself should he realize someone needs healing, by spending a standard action. A vitalist can do this a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Wisdom modifier.
