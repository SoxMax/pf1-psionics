  description:
    value: |-
      <p>When a vitalist reaches 3rd level, all willing members of his collective (including the vitalist himself) can communicate with each other telepathically, even if they do not share a common language. Psionic creatures who are willing members in a vitalist's collective (including the vitalist himself) may manifest unknown powers from powers known by another willing psionic creature in the collective as if they were making physical contact.
      </p><p>A vitalist may temporarily deactivate, and reactivate, this ability as a swift action.
      </p><p></p>
