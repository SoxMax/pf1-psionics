  description:
    value: |-
      <p>At 3rd level, a vitalist has learned to siphon the health of a creature and use it for his own needs or the needs of his collective. As a touch attack, the vitalist may deal a number of hit points in damage to the target equal to his vitalist level + his Wisdom modifier and heal an equal amount of damage. The vitalist may share any healing from this effect over his collective, even if he himself would not be eligible for the healing. A vitalist may not heal more hit points than the touched creature had prior to using this ability.
      </p><p>This ability may only be used on creatures with a Constitution score and may not be used against creatures in the vitalist's collective. A vitalist may use this ability on creatures with a total number of hit dice less than half his vitalist level, but he gains no healing from it.
      </p><p>For example, Jorus is a level 3 vitalist with a Wisdom of 16 and 15 hit points. Jorus has suffered 3 hit points of damage and uses Steal Health on a nearby 2 hit dice orc, dealing 6 hit points of damage (3 from his levels in vitalist, 3 from his Wisdom modifier). Although Jorus may only heal himself for 3 hit points, he may distribute the other 3 hit points over the collective to other members as needed. If Jorus was level 6, he would have dealt 9 points of damage, but would not have received any healing because the orc's total number of hit dice was too low.
      </p><p>At 7th level, a vitalist is able to use steal health as a ranged touch attack with a range of 30 feet.
