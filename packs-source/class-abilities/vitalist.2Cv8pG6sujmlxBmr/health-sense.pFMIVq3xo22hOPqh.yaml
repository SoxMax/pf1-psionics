      - Vitalist
  description:
    value: |-
      <p>Beginning at 2nd level, a vitalist may take a swift action to gauge the relative health level of collective members, determining the amount of damage, in hit points, that an ally has taken. In addition, the vitalist may make a Heal check as a standard action, with a DC of 15, to determine if any of the members of his collective are afflicted by a disease or poison.
      </p><p>Starting at 7th level, the vitalist can make a Heal check over his collective to stabilize a dying target or treat a wound from a caltrop, spike growth, spike stones, or similar. This ability improves at 12th level, and the vitalist may make a Heal check over his collective to treat a poisoned creature.
      </p><p>At 17th level, the vitalist is able to treat diseases in the same fashion, making a Heal check over his collective.
      </p><p>When treating a target over a collective, the DC of the Heal check is the same as if the vitalist was treating the target normally.
