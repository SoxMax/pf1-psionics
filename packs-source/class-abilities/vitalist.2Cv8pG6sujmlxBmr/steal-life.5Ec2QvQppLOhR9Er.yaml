  description:
    value: |-
      <p>Beginning at 14th level, a vitalist can not only steal the health of a target, but steal their life itself. By making a successful melee touch attack and expending psionic focus, the vitalist can force the target to make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + half class level + Wisdom modifier) or die. A successful save negates this effect. Targets with more than 140 hit points are unaffected by this ability.
      </p><p>If the target fails the save, the vitalist is able to channel the stolen life force through his collective, healing any number of the members of his collective for a combined total of 5 hit points per hit die the original target had.
      </p><p>This ability may only be used on creatures with a Constitution score and may not be used against creatures in the vitalist's collective.
      </p><p>For example, Jorus is a level 14 vitalist and he uses steal life on a thought slayer, which has 11 hit dice. The thought slayer fails the Fortitude save, so Jorus can heal up to 55 hit points over his collective, divided among the members as he sees fit.
      </p><p>A vitalist must wait 10 minutes after using this ability before he can attempt to use it again. This is considered a death effect.
