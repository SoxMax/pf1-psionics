  description:
    value: |-
      <p><b>uncanny dodge:</b> Starting at 6th level, a voyager can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does she lose her Dex bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A voyager with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action (see Combat) against her.If a voyager already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.
