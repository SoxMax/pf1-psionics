  description:
    value: |-
      <p><b>Hidden pattern:</b> A cryptic learns how to recognize patterns in light and sound around her that can help her to mask her presence. At 2nd level, a cryptic gains a +2 competence bonus on all Stealth checks. This bonus increases to +4 at 5th level, and then again to +6 at 8th level. At 10th level, as long as the cryptic maintains psionic focus, she can use the Stealth skill to hide, even while being observed.
