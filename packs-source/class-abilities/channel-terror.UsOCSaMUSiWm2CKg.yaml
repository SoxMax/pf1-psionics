  description:
    value: |-
      <p><b>channel terror:</b> At 3rd level, the dread learns how to channel her terrors through any melee weapon she is holding or through her devastating touch class feature, even if using devastating touch as a ranged attack (such as through the mindlock terror). If channeling a terror through a weapon, it does not gain the benefits of the devastating touch ability.
