  description:
    value: |-
      <p><b>style mantra:</b> At 3rd level, a Marksman gains a mantra associated with her combat style that is active as long as she maintains psionic focus. A Marksman may not use her style mantra at the same time she uses Wind Reader; she may only gain the benefit of one or the other, not both.
