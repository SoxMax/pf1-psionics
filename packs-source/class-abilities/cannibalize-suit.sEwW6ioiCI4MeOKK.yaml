  description:
    value: |-
      <p><b>cannibalize suit:</b> Starting at 12th level, an aegis learns to convert the psionic energy used to create his suit into healing power. Once per day as a standard action, he can dismiss his astral suit and heal a number of hit points equal to his customization pool. The aegis cannot reform his suit again for one minute after using this ability. Every two levels thereafter, the aegis can use this ability an additional time per day. Additional customization points gained from Augment Suit are not counted for this ability.
