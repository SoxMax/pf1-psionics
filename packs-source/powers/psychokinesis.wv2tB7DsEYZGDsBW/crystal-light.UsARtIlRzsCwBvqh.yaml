  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Upon manifesting this power, you cause one crystalline creature or
      object (glass, crystal, gem, psicrystal, astral construct, etc.) to glow
      in one of two ways. You can cause it to glow with a steady light
      equivalent to a torch, in which case the duration lasts up to 1 minute per
      manifester level. Alternately, you can cause it to flash brightly once,
      causing one creature of your choice in that square or immediately adjacent
      to be dazzled for 1 minute unless it makes a successful Fortitude save.
      Crystalline creatures or objects which are targeted to glow are allowed a
      Will save to negate the power completely; if such is also the target of a
      dazzling flash, the creature being dazzled is also allowed a Fortitude
      save to avoid being dazzled.
