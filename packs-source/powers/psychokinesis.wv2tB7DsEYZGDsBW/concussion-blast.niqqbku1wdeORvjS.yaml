      <p>A subject you select is pummeled with telekinetic force for 1d6 points
      of force damage. You can choose to instead have the power deal an equal
      amount of nonlethal damage. Concussion blast always affects a subject
      within range that you can see, even if the subject is in melee or has
      cover or concealment (you cannot use this power against creatures with
      total cover or total concealment).

      </p>

      <p>Nonmagical, unattended objects (including doors, walls, locks, and so
      on) may also be damaged by this power.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> You can augment this power in one or both of
      the following ways.

      </p><ol><li>For every 2 additional power points you spend, this power's
      damage increases by 1d6 points.</li><li>For every 2 additional power
      points you spend, this power can affect an additional target. Any
      additional target cannot be more than 15 feet from another target of the
      power.</li></ol>
