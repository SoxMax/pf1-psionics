      <p>A giant band of yellow light surrounds your foes then snaps out of
      existence as they smash against one another. When you manifest this power,
      you select two creatures that are beside each other and push them
      violently together, dealing 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage to each. Both
      of your targets may make a Reflex save to attempt to reduce the damage
      taken by half.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment: </strong>This power may be augmented in one of the
      following ways.

      </p><ul><li>For every additional power point you spend, the damage dealt
      to each creature increases by 1d6. Also, for every extra 2d6 damage, the
      DC of this power increases by 1.</li><li>By spending an additional two
      power points, targets that fail their Reflex saves are knocked prone in
      addition to taking damage.</li></ul>
