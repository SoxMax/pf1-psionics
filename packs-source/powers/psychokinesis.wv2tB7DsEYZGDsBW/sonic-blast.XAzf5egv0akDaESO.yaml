      <p>The next successful attack you make this turn deals an additional +1d6
      points of sonic damage.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Trigger:</strong> If your attack was successful and the target
      makes an attack during its next turn, you can expend your psionic focus to
      make a free trip attempt against the target before it makes the attack.
      This trip attempt does not provoke attacks of opportunity and you are not
      knocked prone if you fail by more than 10. Power resistance applies to
      this triggered effect only; it does not apply to the additional damage on
      your attack.
