      <p>You encase yourself and your allies in a shimmering fortress of
      telekinetic force. All damage from powers and psi-like abilities taken by
      subjects inside the area of the intellect fortress, including ability
      damage, is halved. This lowering takes place prior to the effects of other
      powers or abilities that lessen damage, such as damage reduction and
      evasion.

      </p>

      <p>Powers that are not subject to power resistance are not affected by an
      intellect fortress.

      the following ways.

      duration increases by 1 round.</li><li>By spending 4 additional power
      points, this power may also affect breath weapons that deal
      damage.</li></ol>
