      <p>Powers and psi-like effects targeted on you are reversed back upon the
      original manifester. Reddopsi turns only powers that have you as a target.
      Effect and area powers are not affected. Reddopsi also fails to stop touch
      range powers. Up to 15 power points (or eight spell levels in
      psionic-magic transparency games) worth of powers are reversed in this
      fashion.

      </p>

      <p>When you are targeted by a power using a higher amount of power points
      than the amount of reddopsi you have left, that power is partially
      reversed. Subtract the amount of reddopsi left from the power points of
      the incoming power, then divide the result by the total power points of
      the incoming power to see what fraction of the effect gets through. For
      damaging powers, you and the manifester each take a fraction of the
      damage. For nondamaging powers, each of you has a proportional chance to
      be the one who is affected. If you and a manifesting attacker are both
      warded by reddopsi effects in operation, a resonating field is created.
      Roll randomly to determine the result.
