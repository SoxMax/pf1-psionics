          All psionic effects and psionic items within a 40-ft.radius burst, or
          one psionic item (see text)
  description:
    value: >-
      <p>All psionic effects and psionic items within the radius of the power,
      except for those that you carry or touch, are disjoined. That is, powers
      and psi-like effects are unraveled and destroyed completely (ending the
      effect as a dispel psionics power does), and each permanent psionic item
      must make a successful Will save or be turned into a normal item for the
      duration of this power. An item in a creature's possession uses its own
      Will save bonus or its possessor's Will save bonus, whichever is higher.
      If an item's saving throw results in a natural 1 on the die, the item is
      destroyed instead of being suppressed.

      </p>

      <p>You also have a 1% chance per manifester level of destroying a null
      psionics field. If the null psionics field survives the disjunction, no
      items within it are disjoined.

      </p>

      <p>You can also use this power to target a single item. The item gets a
      Will save at a –5 penalty to avoid being permanently destroyed. Even
      artifacts are subject to disjunction, though there is only a 1% chance per
      manifester level of actually affecting such powerful items. If successful,
      the artifact's power unravels, and it is destroyed (with no save). If an
      artifact is destroyed, you must make a DC 25 Will save or permanently lose
      all manifesting abilities. These abilities cannot be recovered by mortal
      power, not even reality revision, miracle, or wish. Destroying artifacts
      is a dangerous business, and it is 95% likely to attract the attention of
      some powerful being who has an interest in or connection with the device.
