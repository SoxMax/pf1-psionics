      <p>The next successful melee attack you make this turn deals an additional
      +1d6 points of cold damage.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Trigger:</strong> If your attack was successful and the target
      makes an attack during its next turn, you can expend your psionic focus to
      give it a -2 penalty to that attack and all other attacks it makes during
      that turn. Power resistance applies to this triggered effect only; it does
      not apply to the additional damage on your attack.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> If you spend 6 additional power points, you
      can instead manifest this power upon making a successful melee attack and
      have the effects of this power instead apply to that attack. Doing so
      still uses your swift action for the round.

      </p>
