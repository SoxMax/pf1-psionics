    value: >-
      <p>You create a ray of your active energy type (cold, electricity, fire,
      or sonic) that shoots forth from your fingertip and strikes a target
      within range, dealing damage if you succeed on a ranged touch attack with
      the ray.

      </p><ul><li><em>Cold:</em> A ray of this energy type deals 2 points of
      damage. Alternately, the manifester can choose to deal no damage but
      instead chill up to 1 pound of non-living material (such as cooling a
      drink).</li></ul>

      <ul><li><em>Electricity:</em> A ray of this energy type deals 1 point of
      damage. Manifesting a ray of this energy type provides a +3 bonus on your
      attack roll if the target is wearing metal armor and a +2 bonus on
      manifester level checks for the purpose of overcoming power resistance.
      Alternately, the manifester can choose to deal no damage but instead cause
      a relatively harmless static shock. This shock is painful enough to wake
      someone sleeping, but is not painful to interrupt concentration or
      spellcasting.</li></ul>

      <ul><li><em>Fire:</em> A ray of this energy type deals 2 points of damage.
      Alternately, the manifester can choose to deal no damage but instead light
      a readily flammable object such as a lantern or torch, or warm up to 1
      pound of nonliving material (such as heating food).</li></ul>

      <ul><li><em>Sonic:</em> A ray of this energy type deals 1 point of damage
      and ignores an object's hardness. Alternately, the manifester can choose
      to deal no damage but instead cause a loud bang at the target location (DC
      10 Perception check to hear it).</li></ul>

      <p>This power's subtype is the same as the type of energy you manifest.
