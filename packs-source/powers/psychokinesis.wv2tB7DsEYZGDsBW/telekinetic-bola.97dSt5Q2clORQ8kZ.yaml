      <p>A small number of items become animated, hurling about your person in a
      dizzying orbit, ready to act at your behest. When you manifest this power,
      you must choose one of two modes in which you intend it to be used. Once
      chosen, this choice cannot be altered until the power ends.

      </p>

      <p>In either case, you cause a set of objects to spin rapidly around you,
      primed to either defend you, or aid in your offense. These objects move
      quickly enough that they do not impair your vision, nor do they provide
      you cover or concealment. The objects so animated remain within your
      square at all times and if they are removed by any means, they cease being
      under the control of the power.

      </p>

      <p><em>Defensive</em>: In this mode, the objects you animate are prepared
      to intercept physical attacks against you. Once per animated object per
      round, you can direct an object to try to block such an attack as a free
      action that can be taken outside of your turn. The animated item moves to
      intercede, providing you a +1 shield bonus against that attack. Unlike
      most cases, this bonus stacks with any shield bonus you have from another
      source.

      </p>

      <p><em>Offensive: </em>In this mode, the objects you animate can be used
      to make offensive attacks. Once per animated object per round, you can
      direct an object to attack a creature that is attacking you as a free
      action. This is resolved after the attack that you are reacting to. You
      make an attack roll using your base attack bonus and adding your
      manifesting ability bonus. If you hit, the animated object deals 1d3
      points of damage. You cannot react with more than one object per attack
      made against you.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment: </strong>For every four additional power points you
      spend, the shield bonus granted increases by +1 or the damage dealt
      increases by 1d3.
