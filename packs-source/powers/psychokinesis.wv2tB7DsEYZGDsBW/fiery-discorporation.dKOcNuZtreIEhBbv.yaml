      <p>You use your mastery of energy to cheat death. If you are within 30
      feet of an open flame, you can use this power. Any damage that would
      reduce you to 0 hit points or lower instead has a chance to discorporate
      you. You attempt a Will save (DC 5 + damage dealt); if it succeeds, you
      take no damage and simply break apart into dozens of flitting tongues of
      flame and vanish, along with all your gear and anything you are holding or
      carrying.

      </p>

      <p>One day later, you reappear adjacent to an open flame nearest to the
      place where you discorporated, seeming to materialize from the fire (you
      choose where you appear along the perimeter of that open flame). While
      discorporated, you do not exist—you can do nothing, nor can any of your
      enemies do anything to you.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every 3 additional power points you
      spend, you gain a +1 bonus on your Will save to determine whether you
      discorporate.
