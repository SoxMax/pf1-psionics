      <p>You can use this power in one of two ways:

      </p><ul><li><em>Move:</em> You move an object, or even a creature, by
      concentrating your mind upon its current location and then the location
      you desire, creating a sustained force. You can move an object weighing no
      more than 250 pounds up to 20 feet per round. A creature can negate the
      effect on an object it possesses or itself with a successful Will save or
      with power resistance. The weight can be moved across the ground or
      through the air. This power ends if the object is forced out of range. If
      you cease concentration, the object falls or stops.</li></ul>

      <ul><li>You can drop a weight and pick up another during the power's
      duration, as long as you don't stop concentrating on maintaining the
      power. An object can be telekinetically manipulated as if you were moving
      it with one hand.</li></ul>

      <ul><li>If you spend at least 5 rounds concentrating on an unattended
      object, you can attempt to break or burst it as if making a Strength
      check, except that you apply your key ability modifier to the check
      instead of your Strength  modifier.</li></ul>

      <ul><li>If a creature succeeds on its Will save against this effect,
      either to prevent you moving the creature or an object in its possession,
      you cannot target another item in that creature's possession nor the
      creature itself unless you manifest the power again. If the creature fails
      its Will save, it may still take its normal actions, except it cannot move
      from its current location.</li></ul>

      <ul><li><em>Thrust:</em> You can affect one or more objects or creatures
      by concentrating your mind upon, sending them in a deadly hail at your
      foes—or simply by hurling your foe! You can hurl one object or creature
      per manifester level (maximum fifteen separate targets), as long as all
      are within the power's range and each is no more than 10 feet away from
      another one. Each object or creature can be hurled a maximum distance of
      10 feet per level.</li></ul>

      <ul><li>You must succeed on ranged attack rolls (one per creature or
      object thrown) to hit the target of the hurled items with the items,
      applying your key ability modifier to the attack roll instead of your
      Dexterity modifier. Hurled weapons deal their standard damage (your
      Strength bonus does not apply; arrows or bolts deal damage as daggers of
      their size when used in this manner). Other objects deal damage ranging
      from 1 point per 25 pounds of weight (for less dangerous objects such as
      an empty barrel) to 1d6 points per 25 pounds of weight (for hard, dense
      objects such as a boulder).</li></ul>

      <ul><li>Creatures are allowed Will saves (and power resistance) to negate
      the effect, as are those whose held possessions are targeted by this
      power. Creatures are not allowed a Will save if an object is thrust at
      them through the use of this power.</li></ul>

      <ul><li>If you use this power to hurl a creature against a solid surface,
      it takes damage as if it had fallen 10 feet (1d6 points).</li></ul>

      <ul><li>If you use the thrust option of this power, the duration is
      instantaneous.</li></ul>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every additional power point you spend,
      the weight limit of the target increases by 25 pounds.
