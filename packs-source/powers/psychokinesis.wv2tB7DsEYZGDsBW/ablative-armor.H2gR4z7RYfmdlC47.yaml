      <p>A heat-haze of warped space surrounds your armor, hinting that it has
      been enhanced beyond expectations. You must be wearing a suit of armor (or
      benefiting from <a rel="nofollow" class="external text"
      href="https://www.aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=inertial%20armor"><em>inertial
      armor</em></a> or similar effect) or wearing bracers of armor (or similar
      item that grants an armor bonus to AC) to manifest this power. Your armor
      bonus to AC increases by two. Each time you are successfully hit by an
      attack (other than an attack that targets touch AC) the improvement
      granted by ablative armor is reduced by one. Once your improvement from
      ablative armor is reduced to zero, this power ends.

      </p>

      <p>While under the effect of this power, your armor is also treated as if
      it had the ghost touch property.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every three additional power points you
      spend, the improvement granted by this power increases by one.
