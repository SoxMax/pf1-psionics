      <p>You can use dispel psionics to end one ongoing power that has been
      manifest on a creature or object or to temporarily suppress the psionic
      abilities of a psionic item. A dispelled power ends as if its duration had
      expired. Some powers, as detailed in their descriptions, can't be defeated
      by dispel psionics. Dispel psionics can dispel (but not counter) psi-like
      effects just as it does powers. The effect of a power with an
      instantaneous duration can't be dispelled, because the psionic effect is
      already over before the dispel psionics can take effect.

      </p><ul><li><em>Targeted Dispel:</em> One object, creature, or power is
      the target of the dispel psionics power. You make one dispel check (1d20 +
      your manifester level) and compare that to the power with highest
      manifester level (DC = 11 + the power's manifester level). If successful,
      that power ends. If not, compare the same result to the power with the
      next highest manifester level. Repeat this process until you have
      dispelled one power affecting the target, or you have failed to dispel
      every power.</li></ul>

      <p>For example, a 7th-level manifester manifests dispel psionics,
      targeting a creature affected by biofeedback (manifester level 12th) and
      flight (manifester level 7th). The manifester level check results in a 19.
      This check is not high enough to end the biofeedback (which would have
      required a 23 or higher), but it is high enough to end the flight (which
      only required a 18). Had the dispel check resulted in a 23 or higher, the
      biofeedback would have been dispelled, leaving the flight intact. Had the
      dispel check been a 17 or less, no powers would have been affected.

      </p>

      <p>You can also use a targeted dispel to specifically end one power
      affecting the target or one power affecting an area (such as a wall of
      fire). You must name the specific power effect to be targeted in this way.
      If your manifester level check is equal to or higher than the DC of that
      power, it ends. No other powers or effects on the target are dispelled if
      your check is not high enough to end the targeted effect. If you target an
      object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing power (such as a
      monster summoned by summon monster), you make a dispel check to end the
      power that conjured the object or creature.

      </p>

      <p>If the object that you target is a psionic item, you make a dispel
      check against the item's manifester level (DC = 11 + the item's manifester
      level). If you succeed, all the item's psionic properties are suppressed
      for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers its psionic properties. A
      suppressed item becomes nonpsionic for the duration of the effect. An
      interdimensional opening (such as a bag of holding) is temporarily closed.
      A psionic item's physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed psionic
      sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and
      deities are unaffected by mortal psionics such as this.

      </p>

      <p>You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any power that
      you manifest yourself.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> This power may be augmented in one of the
      following ways.

      </p><ol><li>If you spend an additional 6 power points, your targeted
      dispel can dispel one power for every four manifester levels you possess,
      starting with the highest level powers and proceeding to lower level
      powers. It also has a chance to dispel any effect that remove curse can
      remove, even if an unaugmented dispel psionics can't dispel that effect.
      The DC of this check is equal to the curse's DC.</li><li>If you spend an
      additional 6 power points, you may</li></ol>

      <p>choose to make an area dispel instead of a targeted dispel.

      </p><ul><li><em>Area Dispel:</em> When dispel psionics is used in this
      way, the power affects everything within a 20-foot-radius burst. Roll one
      dispel check and apply that check to each creature in the area, as if
      targeted by dispel psionics. For each object within the area that is the
      target of one or more powers, apply the dispel check as with creatures.
      Psionic items are not affected by an area dispel.</li></ul>

      <p>For each ongoing area or effect power whose point of origin is within
      the area of the dispel psionics power, apply the dispel check to dispel
      the power. For each ongoing power whose area overlaps that of the dispel
      psionics power, apply the dispel check to end the effect, but only within
      the overlapping area.

      </p>

      <p>If an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing power (such
      as a weapon summoned by call weaponry) is in the area, apply the dispel
      check to end the power that conjured that object or creature (returning it
      whence it came) in addition to attempting to dispel one power targeting
      the creature or object.

      </p>

      <p>You may choose to automatically succeed on dispel checks against any
      power that you have manifested.
