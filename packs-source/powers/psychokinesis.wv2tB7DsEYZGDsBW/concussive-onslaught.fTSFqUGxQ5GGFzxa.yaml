      <p>You direct wave after wave of concussive kinetic energy at a specific
      location, pulverizing any and all creatures within the area of effect. All
      creatures within the area take 3d6 force damage, or half on a successful
      Fortitude save. The damage continues each round in the same area until the
      power expires.

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> This power may be augmented in one or more of
      the following ways.

      </p><ol><li>For every two additional power points spent, the damage done
      each round increases by 1d6 and the save DC increases by 1.</li><li>By
      spending an additional 4 power points, you can redirect what area is
      affected as a standard action that does not provoke attacks of
      opportunity. The newly chosen area must be within the power's range, even
      if you have moved beyond the range of the initial area.</li></ol>
