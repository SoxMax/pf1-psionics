      <p>You surround yourself or the target with a telekinetic barrier that
      slows down all incoming projectiles, draining them of their energy and
      force, causing them to drop to the ground when entering the aura. You and
      all allies inside the aura gain Damage Reduction 20/magic against all
      ranged projectile or thrown attacks. This power lasts until it has
      prevented a total of 50 points of damage.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment: </strong>This power may be augmented in one or both of
      the following ways.

      </p><ol><li>For every additional power point you spend on this power, the
      pool of damage before it is discharged is increased by 50.</li><li>If you
      spend 2 additional power points, the damage reduction changes to 20/-
      instead of 20/magic.</li></ol>
