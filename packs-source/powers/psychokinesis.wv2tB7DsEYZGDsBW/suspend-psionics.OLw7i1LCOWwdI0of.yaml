      <p>The visible auras of magic surrounding you dampen noticeably,
      signifying some reduction in effect. When you manifest this power, you
      select one ongoing power in that is currently manifested upon you. While
      you concentrate, the selected power is suppressed, its benefits cease and
      its remaining duration stops decreasing. Once you cease concentrating, the
      power immediately springs back into effect and resumes its normal
      duration.

      </p>

      <p>You can only specify powers that you have manifested upon yourself and
      powers you have voluntarily failed your saving throws against; <em>suspend
      psionics </em>cannot be used upon powers that were placed upon you by
      enemies.
