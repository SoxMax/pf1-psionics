      <p>You can affect a foe by concentrating your mind upon its current status
      and the status you desire, once per round. You can perform a bull rush, a
      disarm, a grapple (including a pin), or a trip. Resolve these attempts as
      normal, except that they don't provoke attacks of opportunity, you use
      your manifester level in place of your base attack bonus, you use your key
      ability modifier in place of your Strength modifier or Dexterity modifier,
      and a failed attempt doesn't result in you being disarmed or knocked prone
      (if attempting a disarm or trip). No save is allowed against these
      attempts, but power resistance applies normally.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every 2 additional power points you
      spend, this power grants a +1 bonus on your CMB.
