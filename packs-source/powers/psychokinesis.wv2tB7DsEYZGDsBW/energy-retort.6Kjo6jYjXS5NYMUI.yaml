    value: >-
      <p>You weave a field of potential energy of your active energy type (cold,
      electricity, fire, or sonic) around your body. The first successful attack
      made against you in each round during the power's duration prompts a
      response from the field without any effort on your part. The attack may be
      physical, the effect of a power, or the effect of a spell (including
      spell-like, supernatural, and extraordinary abilities). An "ectoburst"
      discharges from the field, targeting the source of the attack and dealing
      4d6 points of damage of the active energy type. To be affected, a target
      must be within close range, you must have line of sight and line of effect
      to it, and you must be able to identify the source of the attack. The
      ectoburst automatically strikes the enemy who successfully attacked you,
      so long as it meets the above criteria.

      </p><ul><li><em>Cold:</em> A field of this energy type deals +1 point of
      damage per die. The saving throw to reduce damage from a cold retort is a
      Fortitude save instead of a Reflex save.</li></ul>

      <ul><li><em>Electricity:</em> Manifesting a field of this energy type
      provides a +2 bonus to the save DC and a +2 bonus on manifester level
      checks for the purpose of overcoming power resistance.</li></ul>

      <ul><li><em>Fire:</em> A field of this energy type deals +1 point of
      damage per die.</li></ul>

      <ul><li><em>Sonic:</em> A field of this energy type deals –1 point of
      damage per die and ignores an object's hardness.</li></ul>

      <p>This power's subtype is the same as the type of energy you manifest.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every additional power point you spend,
      this power's duration increases by 1 minute.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> A kineticist does not need to select an
      energy type for this power when he gains psionic focus. He may choose the
      type of damage at the time the power is manifested.
