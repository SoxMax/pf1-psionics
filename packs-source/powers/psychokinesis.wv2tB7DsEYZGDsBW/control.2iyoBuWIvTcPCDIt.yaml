      <p>You reach out with your mind and seize control of another creature’s
      body – either through manipulating their body, using direct force on their
      limbs, or by hijacking their mind. Regardless, if the target fails their
      save (Fortitude if this is a psychometabolism or psychokinesis power, Will
      if this is a telepathy power), you can have them do one of the following
      actions immediately:

      </p><ul><li>Move up to their speed (this movement provokes attacks of
      opportunity)</li><li>Make a single attack with a held weapon or a natural
      attack</li><li>Prohibit movement for one round</li><li>Prohibit attacks
      with one held weapon or one natural attack for one round</li></ul>

      <p><strong>Augment: </strong>This power may be augmented in one or more of
      the following ways.

      </p><ul><li>For every 2 additional power points you spend, you can choose
      another target.</li><li>If you spend 2 additional power points, the range
      becomes Medium (100 ft. + 10ft./lvl).</li><li>For every 2 power points
      spent on the above augments, increase the save DC by 1.</li></ul>
