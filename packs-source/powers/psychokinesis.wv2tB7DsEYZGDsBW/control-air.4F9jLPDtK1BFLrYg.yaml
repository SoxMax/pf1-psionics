      <p>You have some control over wind speed and direction.

      </p>

      <p>The speed of the wind within the area of this power can be increased or
      decreased by up to 10 miles per hour.

      </p>

      <p>This power also gives you the ability to alter the direction of the
      wind by as much as 90 degrees.

      </p>

      <p>Powerful enough winds can cause creatures to be blown away, knocked
      down, or checked.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every additional power point you spend,
      you can modify the wind speed by an additional 10 miles per hour, to a
      maximum change in wind speed of 60 miles per hour.
