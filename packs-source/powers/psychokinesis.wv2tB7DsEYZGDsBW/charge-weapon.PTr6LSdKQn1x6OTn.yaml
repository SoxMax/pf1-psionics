    value: >-
      <p>You touch a weapon, filing it with a humming charge of your current
      energy type. The weapon gains a charge of 3d6 energy damage that the
      wielder can choose to unleash with an attack. The wielder chooses how many
      dice to add to an attack before making the attack roll; if the attack
      misses, the damage is lost. In addition, attacks made with the weapon have
      a secondary effect depending on the energy type.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Energy type:</strong></p><ul><li><em>Fire </em>– you deal 1
      point of fie damage with all attacks with the charged
      weapon.</li><li><em>Cold </em>– all attacks with the charged weapon slow
      down enemies, anyone hit while the weapon is charged takes a 5 ft penalty
      to their speed in their next turn.</li><li><em>Electricity </em>– you gain
      a +2 bonus to attacks against creatures made of metal or in metal armor
      while the weapon is charged.</li><li><em>Sonic </em>– all attacks with the
      charged weapon ignores ½ hardness on all attacks as the weapon
      vibrates.</li></ul>

      <p><strong>Augment: </strong>This power may be augmented in one or more of
      the following ways.

      </p><ul><li>For every additional power point you spend, increase the
      damage by 1d6.</li><li>If you spend 3 additional power points, increase
      the dice size to d8.</li><li>If you spend 5 additional power points,
      increase the dice size to d10.</li></ul>
