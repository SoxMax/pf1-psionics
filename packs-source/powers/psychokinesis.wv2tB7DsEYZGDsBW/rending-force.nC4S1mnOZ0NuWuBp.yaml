      target:
        value: One creature
  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You rip the body of the target creature apart with telekinetic force,
      rending it limb from limb. The target creature suffers 9d6 points of
      damage. If this damage reduces the target's hit point total by more than
      half, a limb is removed from the creature's body flies 15 feet in a random
      direction away from the creature and causes the affected creature to
      bleed. The creature suffers one additional 5 points of damage each round.
      The bleeding can be stopped by a DC 15 Heal check or the application of
      any effect that heals hit point damage, but the limb can only be restored
      by powerful healing effects such as regeneration or heal.

      </p>

      <p>If the damage reduces the target's hit points to below zero, all of its
      limbs are affected in this fashion.

      </p>

      <p>Creatures without a discernible anatomy or limbs are unaffected by
      rending force.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> This power can be augmented in one or more of
      the following ways.

      </p><ol><li>If you spend 2 additional power points, the damage dealt uses
      d8 instead of d6.</li><li>If you spend 2 additional power points, a limb
      is removed if the damage reduces the target's hit point total by more than
      1/4.</li><li>If you spend 2 additional power points, the target is also
      sickened if a limb is removed.</li></ol>

      <p>In addition, for each power point spent augmenting this power, the
      damage increases by an additional die of damage.
