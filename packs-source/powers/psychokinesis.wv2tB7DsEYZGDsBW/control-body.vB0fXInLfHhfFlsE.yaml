  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You psychokinetically control the actions of any humanoid (including
      undead or outsiders with a humanoid physiology) that is within range and
      to which you have line of sight. Control body doesn't require mental
      contact with the subject, since you are actually forcing limb movements
      independent of the target's mind. You can force the subject to stand up,
      sit down, walk, turn around, and so on, but operating the vocal cords is
      too difficult. You can also hold the subject immobile, rendering it
      helpless. You cannot force the subject to manifest powers, cast spells, or
      use any special ability that is not a function of just its body movements.
      If you lose line of sight to the subject, the effect of this power ends.

      </p>

      <p>If you force the subject to engage in combat, its attack bonus is equal
      to your base attack bonus + your Intelligence bonus, and its bonus on
      damage rolls is equal to your Intelligence bonus. A subject of this power
      cannot make attacks of opportunity. The subject gains no benefit to Armor
      Class from its Dexterity, but it does gain a bonus to its AC equal to your
      Intelligence bonus.

      </p>

      <p>Although the subject's body is under your control, the subject's mind
      is not. Creatures capable of taking purely mental actions (such as
      manifesting powers) can do so. The subject may make an additional
      Fortitude save each round you maintain concentration.

      </p>

      <p>The subject is treated as being staggered and may only perform a single
      move action or standard action under your direction each round.

      </p>

      <p>You cannot be the target of your own control body power.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> This power may be augmented in one or both of
      the following ways.

      </p><ol><li>For every 2 additional power points you spend, this power can
      affect a target one size category larger.</li><li>If you spend 4
      additional power points, the controlled target is no longer treated as
      being staggered.</li></ol>
