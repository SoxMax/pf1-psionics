        value: Matter in a 40-ft.-radius spread
  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You use telekinetic force to manipulate matter in the affected area,
      including wood, metal, grasses, bushes, and even trees, to entwine
      creatures in the affected area or those that enter the area, causing them
      to become entangled. The individual pieces of matter affected must weigh
      less than 25 lbs each and either cannot be permanently affixed or must be
      able to sufficiently reach creatures within the area. Affected creatures
      can break free and move half their normal speed by using a full-round
      action to make a DC 20 Strength check or a DC 20 Escape Artist check. A
      creature that succeeds on a Reflex save is not entangled but can still
      move at only half speed through the area. Each round you concentrate, you
      may once again direct the debris to attempt to entangle all creatures that
      have avoided or escaped entanglement.

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> This power may be augmented in one or more of
      the following ways.

      </p><ol><li>For each additional 2 power points spent, this power can
      affect an area 5 ft. larger in radius.</li><li>By spending an additional 4
      power points, this power causes 2d6 points of damage per round to
      creatures that failed their Reflex save.</li></ol>

      <p>In addition, for every 2 additional power points you spend to achieve
      any of these effects, this power's save DC increases by 1.
