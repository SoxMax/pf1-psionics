      <p>You create a flood of energy of your active energy type (cold,
      electricity, fire, or sonic) out of unstable ectoplasm that deals 13d6
      points of damage to each creature and object in the area. This power
      originates at your hand and extends outward in a cone.

      </p><ul><li><em>Cold:</em> A wave of this energy type deals +1 point of
      damage per die. The saving throw to reduce damage from a cold wave is a
      Fortitude save instead of a Reflex save.</li></ul>

      <ul><li><em>Electricity:</em> Manifesting a wave of this energy type
      provides a +2 bonus to the save DC and a +2 bonus on manifester level
      checks for the purpose of overcoming power resistance.</li></ul>

      <ul><li><em>Fire:</em> A wave of this energy type deals +1 point of damage
      per die.</li></ul>

      <ul><li><em>Sonic:</em> A wave of this energy type deals –1 point of
      damage per die and ignores an object's hardness.</li></ul>

      <p>This power's subtype is the same as the type of energy you manifest.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every additional power point you spend,
      this power's damage increases by one die (d6). For each extra two dice of
      damage, this power's save DC increases by 1.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> A kineticist does not need to select an
      energy type for this power when he gains psionic focus. He may choose the
      type of damage at the time the power is manifested.
