      <p>You release a powerful stroke of your active energy type (cold,
      electricity, fire, or sonic) that encircles all creatures in the area,
      dealing 1d6 points of damage to each of them. In addition, any creature
      that fails its save for half damage must succeed on a Will save or be
      stunned for 1 round.

      </p><ul><li><em>Cold:</em> A stroke of this energy type deals +1 point of
      damage per die. The saving throw to reduce damage from a cold stun is a
      Fortitude save instead of a Reflex save.</li></ul>

      <ul><li><em>Electricity:</em> Manifesting a stroke of this energy type
      provides a +2 bonus to the save DC and a +2 bonus on manifester level
      checks for the purpose of overcoming power resistance.</li></ul>

      <ul><li><em>Fire:</em> A stroke of this energy type deals +1 point of
      damage per die.</li></ul>

      <ul><li><em>Sonic:</em> A stroke of this energy type deals –1 point of
      damage per die and ignores an object's hardness.</li></ul>

      <p>This power's subtype is the same as the type of energy you manifest.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every additional power point you spend,
      this power's damage increases by one die (d6). For every two additional
      dice of damage, the power's save DC increases by 1.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> A kineticist does not need to select an
      energy type for this power when he gains psionic focus. He may choose the
      type of damage at the time the power is manifested.
