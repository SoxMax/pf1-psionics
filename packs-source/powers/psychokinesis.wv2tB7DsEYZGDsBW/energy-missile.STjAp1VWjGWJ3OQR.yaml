      <p>You release a powerful missile of your active energy type (cold,
      electricity, fire, or sonic) at your foe. The missile deals 3d6 points of
      damage to each creature or unattended object you target, to the maximum of
      five targets. You cannot hit the same target multiple times with the same
      manifestation of this power.

      </p><ul><li><em>Cold:</em> A missile of this energy type deals +1 point of
      damage per die. The saving throw to reduce damage from a cold missile is a
      Fortitude save instead of a Reflex save.</li></ul>

      <ul><li><em>Electricity:</em> Manifesting a missile of this energy type
      provides a +2 bonus to the save DC and a +2 bonus on manifester level
      checks for the purpose of overcoming power resistance.</li></ul>

      <ul><li><em>Fire:</em> A missile of this energy type deals +1 point of
      damage per die.</li></ul>

      <ul><li><em>Sonic:</em> A missile of this energy type deals –1 point of
      damage per die and ignores an object's hardness.</li></ul>

      <p>This power's subtype is the same as the type of energy you manifest.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every additional power point you spend,
      this power's damage increases by one die (d6). For every two additional
      dice of damage, the power's save DC increases by 1.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> A kineticist does not need to select an
      energy type for this power when he gains psionic focus. He may choose the
      type of damage at the time the power is manifested.
