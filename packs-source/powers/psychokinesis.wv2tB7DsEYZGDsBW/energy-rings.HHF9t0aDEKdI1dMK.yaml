      <p>You create an immobile cylindrical stack of rings of energy of your
      active energy type that surrounds your target, threatening to harm them if
      they move. When initially placed, these rings do no damage, but they
      discourage your foe from undertaking movement. While surrounded by
      <em>energy rings</em>, the targeted creature may still take actions within
      their square as usual, including making ranged or melee attacks, or
      manifesting powers without hindrance.

      </p>

      <p>In order to escape the <em>energy rings</em>, the target must first
      succeed at a Strength check to break the rings. The DC for this check is
      equal to the DC of the power. Attempting to do so requires the target to
      directly contact the rings, which deals 5d6 points of damage to the
      creature touching the rings. This power ends if any of the rings are
      broken.

      </p><ul><li><em>Cold: </em>A set of rings of this energy type deals +1
      point of damage per die. The saving throw to reduce damage from <em>cold
      rings </em>is a Fortitude save instead of a Reflex
      save.</li><li><em>Electricity: </em>Manifesting a set of rings of this
      energy type provides a +2 bonus to the save DC and a +2 bonus on
      manifester level checks for the purpose of overcoming power
      resistance.</li><li><em>Fire: </em>A set of rings of this energy type
      deals +1 point of damage per die.</li><li><em>Sonic: </em>A bolt of this
      energy type deals -1 point of damage per die and ignores an object’s
      hardness.</li></ul>

      <p>This power’s subtype is the same as the type of energy you manifest.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment: </strong>You can augment this power in one or both of
      the following ways:

      </p><ul><li>For every additional power point you spend, this power’s
      damage increases by one die (d6).</li><li>For every two additional power
      points you spend, this power can affect a creature one size category
      larger.</li></ul>

      <p>Additionally, for each two power points spent on either augment, this
      power’s save DC increases by 1.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Special: </strong>A kineticist does not need to select an
      energy type for this power when he gains psionic focus. He may choose the
      type of damage at the time the power is manifested.
