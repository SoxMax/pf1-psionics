      <p>You interweave your mind and power with that of another creature,
      allowing you to either empower their spells or to draw power from the
      spells they cast. Whenever the target casts a spell, you can augment that
      spell as an immediate action. For every 2 power points you spend
      augmenting it, increase the effective caster level of that spell by 1. For
      every 3 power points you spend augmenting it, increase its effective spell
      level by 1. Both of these uses stack with each other, but you cannot spend
      more than your manifester level on a single augment. (For example, if you
      spend 6 power points to augment a spell, the caster level increases by 3
      and the spell level by 2).

      </p>

      <p>The other use of this power allows you to siphon some of the power of a
      spell into your own power reserves. As an immediate action when the target
      casts a spell, you regain 1 power point for every 2 spell levels of the
      spell they cast. This use of the power immediately ends the effect.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment: </strong>This power may be augmented in one or more of
      the following ways.

      </p><ul><li>If you spend 2 additional power points, the duration increases
      to 10 minutes / level.</li><li>For every 2 power points you spend, you can
      choose another target for this power.</li><li>If you spend 2 additional
      power points, you can augment the spells of your target as a free
      action.</li></ul>
