    value: >-
      <p>Your body's psionically fueled bioenergetic currents produce an arc of
      energy of your active energy type (cold, electricity, fire, or sonic) that
      targets a creature you designate as the primary foe for 9d6 points of
      damage in every round when the power remains in effect. Energy also arcs
      off the primary foe to strike one additional foe that is initially within
      15 feet of the primary foe, or that subsequently moves within 15 feet of
      the primary foe while the duration lasts. Secondary foes take the same
      damage that the primary foe takes in every round while the duration lasts.

      </p>

      <p>Should either the primary or secondary foe fall to less than 0 hit
      points (or should a target completely evade the effect with a special
      ability or power), or should the primary foe move out of range of the
      effect, the energy current's arc randomly retargets another primary and/or
      secondary foe while the duration lasts, depending on which foe or foes can
      no longer be targeted. Targeted foes can move normally, possibly moving
      out of range of the effect, but each round they are targeted and remain in
      range they must make a saving throw to avoid taking full damage in that
      round.

      </p>

      <p>Concentrating to maintain energy current is a full-round action. If you
      take damage while maintaining energy current, you must make a successful
      concentration check (DC 10 + damage dealt) to avoid losing your
      concentration on the power.

      </p>

      <p>The save DC to halve the damage for the secondary target is 2 lower
      than the DC for the primary target.

      </p><ul><li><em>Cold:</em> A current of this energy type deals +1 point of
      damage per die. The saving throw to reduce damage from a cold current is a
      Fortitude save instead of a Reflex save.</li></ul>

      <ul><li><em>Electricity:</em> Manifesting a current of this energy type
      provides a +2 bonus to the save DC and a +2 bonus on manifester level
      checks for the purpose of overcoming power resistance.</li></ul>

      <ul><li><em>Fire:</em> A current of this energy type deals +1 point of
      damage per die.</li></ul>

      <ul><li><em>Sonic:</em> A current of this energy type deals –1 point of
      damage per die and ignores an object's hardness.</li></ul>

      <p>This power's subtype is the same as the type of energy you manifest.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> You can augment this power in one or both of
      the following ways.

      </p><ol><li>For every additional power point you spend, this power's
      damage increases by one die (d6). For each extra two dice of damage, this
      power's save DC increases by 1.</li><li>For every 4 additional power
      points you spend, this power can affect an additional secondary foe. Any
      additional secondary foe cannot be more than 15 feet from another target
      of the power.</li></ol>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> A kineticist does not need to select an
      energy type for this power when he gains psionic focus. He may choose the
      type of damage at the time the power is manifested.
