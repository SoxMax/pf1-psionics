      <p>Your next successful melee attack dazzles the struck creature.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Trigger:</strong> If your attack was successful and the struck
      creature moves or attacks before the end of its next turn, you can expend
      your psionic focus to blind it until the end of its current turn. The
      blindness takes effect at the beginning of the creature's action which
      caused the trigger.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> If you spend 6 additional power points, you
      can instead manifest this power upon making a successful melee attack and
      have the effects of this power instead apply to that attack. Doing so
      still uses your swift action for the round.
