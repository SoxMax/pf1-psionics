    value: >-
      <p>With furrowed brow, you remotely loosen straps, open buckles, and
      otherwise disassemble an enemy’s armor. When you manifest this power, if
      your target fails their saving throw, you may start removing portions of
      their armor, reducing the armor bonus to AC that it grants by 2. Each
      round that you concentrate on this power, the target must make an
      additional saving throw to resist its effects. Failure results in further
      reductions in armor bonus, to a minimum of zero.

      </p>

      <p>As a standard action on their turn, your target may refasten their
      armor, restoring their armor bonus by up to 2, to a maximum of the normal
      armor bonus granted by their armor. Disassembly caused by <em>wardrobe
      malfunction </em>remains after the power ends, and a creature wearing such
      armor must spend actions to reassemble it.

      </p>

      <p>This power does not harm a suit of armor, even one that appears to be
      one integral piece, such as in the case of hide armor. Such armor merely
      becomes improperly seated on its wearer, and can be donned normally once
      this power’s influence is ended.

      </p>

      <p>This power does not affect armor bonuses granted from sources other
      than armor, such as that granted by <em>inertial armor </em>or <em>bracers
      of armor</em>.

      </p>

      <p><em>Wardrobe malfunction </em>can be similarly used upon common
      clothing. In this case, each round you may designate a single article of
      clothing your target is wearing. If the target fails its saving throw that
      round, the item slips off of them.
