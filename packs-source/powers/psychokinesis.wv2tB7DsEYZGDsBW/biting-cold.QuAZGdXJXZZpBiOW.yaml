      <p>The next successful melee attack you make this round deals an
      additional +1d10 points of cold damage to the struck creature and the
      target is staggered from the cold. Power resistance does not apply to this
      additional damage, but does apply to the staggered condition.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Trigger:</strong> If your attack was successful, you can expend
      your psionic focus to infuse the target with chilling cold. Power
      resistance applies to infusing the target with chilling cold. Until the
      end of its next turn, if the creature struck makes an attack, manifests a
      power, or casts a spell, it takes 1d10 points of cold damage and is
      paralyzed for one round.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> If you spend 6 additional power points, you
      can instead manifest this power upon making a successful melee attack and
      have the effects of this power instead apply to that attack. Doing so
      still uses your swift action for the round.
