      <p>The next single successful melee attack you make this round deals an
      additional +1d6 points of electricity damage and charges the creature with
      static energy.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Trigger:</strong> If the target moves during its next turn and
      your attack was successful, you can expend your psionic focus to deal an
      additional 2d6 points of electricity damage to it.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> If you spend 6 additional power points, you
      can instead manifest this power upon making a successful melee attack and
      have the effects of this power instead apply to that attack. Doing so
      still uses your swift action for the round.
