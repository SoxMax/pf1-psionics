  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Your eyes beam forth a 40-foot cone of light; for the first 20 feet,
      you shed normal light in such area, and you increase the light level for
      the other 20 feet by one step, up to normal light (darkness becomes dim
      light, and dim light becomes normal light). In an area of normal or bright
      light, this power can be manifested but it has no effect, until you enter
      into an area with a lower light level.

      </p>

      <p>If my light is used in conjunction with elfsight, the cone of light
      extends out to 80 feet instead of 40 feet.

      </p>

      <p>If my light is used in conjunction with control light, the cone of
      light extends out to 60 feet instead of 20 feet.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> You can augment this power in one of the
      following ways.

      </p><ol><li>If you spend 2 additional power points, you can manifest this
      power as a swift action.</li><li>If you expend your psionic focus when
      manifesting this power, the cost of the power is reduced by 1 (to a
      minimum of 0).</li></ol>
