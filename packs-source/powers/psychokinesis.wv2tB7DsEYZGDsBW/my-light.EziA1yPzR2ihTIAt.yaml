      <p>Your eyes beam forth a 40-foot cone of light; for the first 20 feet,
      you shed normal light in such area, and you increase the light level for
      the other 20 feet by one step, up to normal light (darkness becomes dim
      light, and dim light becomes normal light). In an area of normal or bright
      light, this power can be manifested but it has no effect, until you enter
      into an area with a lower light level.</p><p>If my light is used in
      conjunction with elfsight, the cone of light extends out to 80 feet
      instead of 40 feet.</p><p>If my light is used in conjunction with control
      light, the cone of light extends out to 60 feet instead of 20
      feet.</p><p><strong>Augment:</strong> You can augment this power in one of
      the following ways.</p><ol><li>If you spend 2 additional power points, you
      can manifest this power as a swift action.</li></ol>
