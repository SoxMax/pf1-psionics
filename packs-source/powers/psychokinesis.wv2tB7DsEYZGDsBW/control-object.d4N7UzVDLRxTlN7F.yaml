  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You telekinetically "bring to life" an inanimate object. Though it is
      not actually alive, the object moves under your control. Live vegetation
      cannot be controlled in this fashion, nor can already animated objects or
      undead. The controlled object moves like a puppet, with jerky and clumsy
      movements, at a speed of up to 20 feet. If its form is rigid, it makes
      creaking, groaning, or grating sounds as you control it.

      </p>

      <p>A controlled object can attack an opponent if you direct it to do so.
      It has one slam attack, at a base attack bonus equal to your base attack
      bonus plus your Intelligence modifier. If the attack hits, it deals points
      of damage equal to 1d6 plus your primary ability modifier. A controlled
      object has its usual hardness and hit points.

      </p>

      <p>You can use this power on a nonmagical lock, making it move in such a
      way as to attempt to unlock itself. If another character makes a Disable
      Device check to open a lock in the device that you are concentrating on
      controlling, the character gains a +4 bonus on the check.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> You can augment this power in one or both of
      the following ways.

      </p><ol><li>For every 2 additional power points you spend, you can control
      another object at the same time.</li><li>For every 2 additional power
      points you spend, the weight of the object you can control increases by
      100 lb.</li></ol>
