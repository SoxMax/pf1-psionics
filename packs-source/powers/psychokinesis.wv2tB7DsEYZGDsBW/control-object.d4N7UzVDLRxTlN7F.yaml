    value: >-
      <p>You telekinetically "bring to life" an inanimate object. Though it is
      not actually alive, the object moves under your control. Live vegetation
      cannot be controlled in this fashion, nor can already animated objects or
      undead. The controlled object moves like a puppet, with jerky and clumsy
      movements, at a speed of up to 20 feet. If its form is rigid, it makes
      creaking, groaning, or grating sounds as you control it.</p><p>A
      controlled object can attack an opponent if you direct it to do so. It has
      one slam attack, at a base attack bonus equal to your base attack bonus
      plus your Intelligence modifier. If the attack hits, it deals points of
      damage equal to 1d6 plus your primary ability modifier. A controlled
      object has its usual hardness and hit points.</p><p>You can use this power
      on a nonmagical lock, making it move in such a way as to attempt to unlock
      itself. If another character makes a Disable Device check to open a lock
      in the device that you are concentrating on controlling, the character
      gains a +4 bonus on the check.</p><p><strong>Augment:</strong> You can
      augment this power in one or both of the following ways.</p><ol><li>For
      every 2 additional power points you spend, you can control another object
      at the same time.</li><li>For every 2 additional power points you spend,
      the weight of the object you can control increases by 100 lb.</li></ol>
