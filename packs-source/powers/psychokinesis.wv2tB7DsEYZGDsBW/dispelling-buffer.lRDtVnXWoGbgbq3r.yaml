      <p>You create a psychokinetic shield around the subject that improves the
      chance that any powers affecting the subject will resist a dispel psionics
      power (or a dispel magic spell) or a negation effect that targets a
      specific power (such as shatter mind blank). When dispelling buffer is
      manifested on a creature or object, on each dispel check, add +5 to the DC
      for the ongoing effect that is subject to being dispelled.

      </p>

      <p>Dispel psionics can negate dispelling buffer, but against a targeted
      dispel, dispelling buffer is always checked last (with the same +5 bonus).
      Against an area dispel, dispelling buffer is checked in the order
      according to its level (with the same +5 bonus).

      </p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> When a psychic warrior manifests this power,
      the range is personal and the target is the manifester.
