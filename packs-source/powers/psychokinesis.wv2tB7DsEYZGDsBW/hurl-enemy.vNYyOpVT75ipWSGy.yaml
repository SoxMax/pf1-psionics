    value: >-
      <p>You concentrate on a creature and use telekinesis to try to hurl it at
      another target. The creature being hurled must weigh less than 50 pounds
      per manifester level. If the targeted creature fails its save, you
      forcefully launch it at another target that must be within 30 ft. of the
      affected creature.

      </p>

      <p>Make a ranged touch attack against the target. If the attack is
      successful, deal 7d6 points of damage to both the hurled creature and the
      target of the ranged attack. If the attack misses, deal 3d6 points of
      damage to the hurled

      creature.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every additional power point spent, the
      damage to each creature increases by 1d6. For every additional 2d6 of
      damage, the save DC increases by 1.
