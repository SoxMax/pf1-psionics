      <p>You telekinetically launch an ally (or yourself) across the battlefield
      to anywhere within this power's range. While moving, your ally is flying
      just above the ground unless you wish otherwise. Movement from this power
      provokes attacks of opportunity as normal, although you can lift your ally
      over objects or out of enemy reach, as long as your ally remains within
      range. If your ally lands adjacent to an opponent, he can spend an
      immediate action to make a melee attack against that opponent with a +2
      bonus on the attack roll.
