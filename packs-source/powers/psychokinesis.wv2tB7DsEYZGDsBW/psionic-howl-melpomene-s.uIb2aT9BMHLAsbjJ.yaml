      <p>You unleash a blast of charged sonic energy that manifests as a howling
      shriek. Creatures and objects within the area suffer 3d4 points of sonic
      damage, which ignores the hardness of objects, and creatures that fail
      their saves become deafened for 1 round per manifester level as the sound
      persists in their minds, drowning out all others. The deafened effect is
      mind-affecting.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> You may augment this power in one or both of
      the following ways:

      </p><ol><li>For every additional power point you spend, this power's
      damage increases by one die (d4). For each 2 extra dice of damage, this
      power's save DC increases by 1.</li><li>If you spend an additional 4 power
      points, you may exclude any number of allies and/or objects from the
      power's effects.</li></ol>

      <p><strong>Surge Augmentation:</strong> If you invoke your wild surge
      while manifesting this power, double its range and area.
