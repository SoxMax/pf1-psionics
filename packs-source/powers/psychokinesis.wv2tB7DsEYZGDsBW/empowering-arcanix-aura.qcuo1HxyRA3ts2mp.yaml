      <p>When you manifest this power, choose either divine, arcane or psychic
      spells as the vibration your aura is aligned with. Whenever you are the
      target of a spell of this kind, you gain a +2 bonus to saves against it.
      If you successfully save against the effect, you siphon off the energies
      from it to empower yourself. If you manifested this as a psychokinesis
      power, you gain 1 temporary hit point per spell level of the spell you
      saved against, and if you manifested this as a clairsentience power, you
      gain a +1 insight bonus to your next d20 roll for every 3 spell levels. If
      the spell doesn’t require a save, or is harmless, you gain half this
      bonus. These bonuses stack with themselves and lasts while the aura is in
      effect.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment: </strong>This power may be augmented in one or more of
      the following ways.

      </p><ul><li>If you spend 2 additional power points, the duration increases
      to 1 minute / level.</li><li>If you spend 4 additional power points, the
      duration increases to 10 minutes / level.</li></ul>
