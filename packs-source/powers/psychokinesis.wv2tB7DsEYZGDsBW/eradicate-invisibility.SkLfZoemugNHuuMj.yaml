  description:

      <p>You radiate a psychokinetic burst that disrupts and negates all types
      of invisibility (though this power can't negate the effect of cloud mind).
      Any creature that fails its save to avoid the effect loses its
      invisibility.

      </p>

      <p>Creatures that are naturally invisible, such as an invisible stalker,
      are revealed as a dim outline for 1 round (until the beginning of your
      next turn) and do not have total concealment during this period.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every additional power point you spend,
      this power's range and the radius of the burst in which it functions both
      increase by 5 feet. For each 10-foot increase, this power's save DC
      increases by 1.
