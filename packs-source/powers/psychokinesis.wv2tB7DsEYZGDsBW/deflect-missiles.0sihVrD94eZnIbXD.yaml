      <p>You surround yourself in a field that slows ranged attacks. You gain
      damage reduction 10/magic against ranged or thrown weapons. This effect
      ends once it has blocked 10 points of damage. You do not gain the ability
      to damage creatures with similar damage reduction. This ability does not
      work on weapon-like spells or powers.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> This power may be augmented in the following
      ways.

      </p><ol><li>For every additional power point spent, the power can block an
      additional 10 points of damage before it ends.</li><li>If you spend 6
      additional power points, you may manifest this power as a swift
      action.</li></ol>
