      <p>You shape and alter existing sounds. You can target one sound, such as
      a person speaking or singing, or a group of related sounds, such as the
      patter of many raindrops or the tramp of soldiers passing by. A sound as
      quiet as a snapping finger can be controlled. You can substitute any sound
      you have heard for the target sound. If you attempt to exactly duplicate
      the voice of a specific individual, or an inherently terrifying sound
      (such as a dragon's roar), you must succeed on a Bluff check with a +5
      circumstance bonus opposed by the intended listener's Sense Motive check
      to avoid arousing suspicion.

      </p>

      <p>You can entirely muffle a noise or magnify a sound to such loudness
      that it drowns out all other conversation in the immediate area. In this
      way, you can provide yourself or any with a +4 circumstance bonus on
      Stealth and audiobased Perception checks.

      </p>

      <p>Alternatively, you can use up the power in an instant. You do this by
      modulating a sound into a one-time destructive impetus that shatters
      nonmagical/nonpsionic, unattended objects of crystal, glass, ceramics, or
      porcelain (vials, bottles, flasks, jugs, mirrors, and so forth) in the
      area.
