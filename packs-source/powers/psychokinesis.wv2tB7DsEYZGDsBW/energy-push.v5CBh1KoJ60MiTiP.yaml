    value: >-
      <p>You project a solid blast of energy of your active energy type (cold,
      electricity, fire, or sonic) at a target, dealing it 2d6 points of damage.
      In addition, if a subject of up to one size category larger than you fails
      a Strength check (DC equal to the save DC of this power), the driving
      force of the energy blast pushes it back 5 feet plus another 5 feet for
      every 5 points of damage it takes. If a wall or other solid object
      prevents the subject from being pushed back, the subject instead slams
      into the object and takes an extra 2d6 points of damage from the impact
      (no save). The movement caused by energy push does not provoke attacks of
      opportunity.

      </p><ul><li><em>Cold:</em> A blast of this energy type deals +1 point of
      damage per die (damage from impact remains at 2d6 points). The saving
      throw to reduce damage from a cold push is a Fortitude save instead of a
      Reflex save.</li></ul>

      <ul><li><em>Electricity:</em> Manifesting a blast of this energy type
      provides a +2 bonus to the save DC and a +2 bonus on manifester level
      checks for the purpose of overcoming power resistance.</li></ul>

      <ul><li><em>Fire:</em> A blast of this energy type deals +1 point of
      damage per die (damage from impact remains at 2d6 points).</li></ul>

      <ul><li><em>Sonic:</em> A blast of this energy type deals –1 point of
      damage per die (damage from impact remains at 2d6 points) and ignores an
      object's hardness.</li></ul>

      <p>This power's subtype is the same as the type of energy you manifest.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every 2 additional power points you
      spend, this power's damage increases by one die (d6) and its save DC
      increases by 1. The damage increase applies to both the initial blast and
      any damage from impact with an object.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> A kineticist does not need to select an
      energy type for this power when he gains psionic focus. He may choose the
      type of damage at the time the power is manifested.
