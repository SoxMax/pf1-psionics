      target:
        value: 1-ft.-diameter/level sphere, centered around creatures or objects
  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A globe of shimmering force encloses a creature, provided the creature
      is small enough to fit within the diameter of the sphere, and contains it
      for the duration of the effect. Anything contained within the sphere
      weighs only onesixteenth of its normal weight. You can telekinetically
      lift anything in the sphere that normally weighs 5,000 pounds or less. The
      telekinetic control extends from you out to medium range (100 feet + 10
      feet per manifester level) after the sphere has succeeded in encapsulating
      its contents.

      </p>

      <p>You can move the sphere, along with the objects and creatures it
      contains that weigh a total of 5,000 pounds or less, by concentrating on
      the sphere. You can begin moving a sphere in the round after manifesting
      the power. If you concentrate on doing so (a standard action), you can
      move the sphere as much as 30 feet in a round. If you cease concentrating,
      the sphere does not move in that round (if on a level surface) or descends
      at its falling rate (if aloft) until it reaches a level surface. You can
      resume concentrating on your next turn or any later turn during the
      duration.

      </p>

      <p>The sphere falls at a rate of only 60 feet per round, which is not fast
      enough to cause damage to the contents of the sphere.

      </p>

      <p>You can move the sphere telekinetically even if you are in it.

      </p>

      <p>The sphere functions as a wall of force, except that it can be negated
      by dispel psionics. A subject inside the sphere can breathe normally. The
      sphere cannot be physically moved either by people outside it or by the
      struggles of those within.
