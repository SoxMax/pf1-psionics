      <p>A shimmering pocket of space opens up near your bow, inviting the
      insertion of a small item. While this power is in effect, you can load an
      alchemical item such as an acid flask or holy water into the space, and
      your next shot will deliver that item in addition to its normal effects.
      Loading this pocket requires a move action but once loaded, the pocket
      remains ready to use until the power expires or you take a shot with your
      weapon.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment: </strong>For every additional two power points you
      spend, you may place an additional alchemical item into the loading pocket
      when you load it, without requiring more time. Such items will still only
      attach one per projectile, so delivering two items requires two shots.
