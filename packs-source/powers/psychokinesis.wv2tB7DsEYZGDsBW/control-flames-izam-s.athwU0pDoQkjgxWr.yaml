      <p>You pyrokinetically control the intensity or movements of one fire
      source. A nonmagical fire source can be controlled if it is equal to or
      smaller than the maximum size of fire you can control according to your
      manifester level, as noted on the accompanying table. You can freely
      switch control between fire sources, or change the nature of your control,
      while you maintain concentration, but only one specified change (keeping a
      fire burning, animating it, or altering its size) can be made to one fire
      source in a round. When your control over a fire source lapses, that fire
      immediately returns to its original state (or goes out if it has no fuel
      or has been moved away from its original location). With this power, you
      can artificially keep a fire burning that would normally expire for lack
      of fuel; even dousing a controlled flame with water does not put it out
      (though completely submerging the flame would). Normally, a creature at
      risk of catching on fire can avoid this fate by making a DC 15 Reflex
      saving throw, with success indicating that the fire has gone out. If the
      fire is one that has been kept burning by the use of control flames, then
      the DC of the Reflex save needed to put out the flames increases to 25.

      </p>

      <p>This power also enables you to make a fire move as if it were a living
      creature. You can animate only a naturally burning fire; if you attempt to
      animate one that has been increased or decreased in size by your
      augmentation of this power, the fire immediately returns to its original
      size. An animated fire moves at a speed of 30 feet. A fire that moves away
      from its fuel or its original location dies as soon as your control over
      it lapses.

      </p>

      <p>An animated fire can enter any square, even if a creature already
      occupies it. If an animated fire enters a square occupied by a creature,
      that creature can make a Reflex save to get out of the way (DC 11 + the
      number of dice of damage the fire does + your key ability modifier). A
      successful Reflex save moves the creature to the nearest unoccupied
      square. The flames deal the indicated damage to any creature that is
      either on fire or surrounded by the flames (in the fire's space); see the
      accompanying table).

      </p>

      <p>At the start of your turn, the animated fire deals damage to any
      creature in its space, and the creature catches on fire unless it makes a
      Reflex save (DC as noted above). A victim on fire takes 1d6 points of
      damage each round. Additional rounds in the same space as the animated
      fire occupies mean additional chances of ignition. The damage from
      multiple normal fires stacks, but the victim gets a saving throw each
      round to negate each fire. It is possible to switch control from the
      animated fire (causing it to disappear) to intensify flames that are
      already burning (thus denying the foe Reflex saves after the first).
