      <p>A bridge of coruscating multi-hued light builds between two creatures,
      photonic evidence of magical redirection. <em>Retarget power </em>can be
      used to move an ongoing magical spell or psionic power from one creature
      to another. Prior to its use, you must have identified the specific single
      spell or power you intend to move either through the use of Spellcraft, or
      by having been the original caster or manifester of the spell or power.
      Simply being told, even by the original caster is insufficient for this
      purpose though any experience equivalent to first-hand knowledge (such as
      by means of mind-reading) is.

      </p>

      <p>You must touch the creature that is currently under the effects of the
      ongoing spell or power. That creature is entitled to a Will saving throw
      to resist your transfer though they may choose to voluntarily fail their
      save as usual. If this condition is satisfied, the target creature you
      select may also make a saving throw to resist accepting the transfer. If
      either creature succeeds at its saving throw, <em>retarget power </em>has
      no effect and the spell or power remains active on its original target.
      Spell resistance applies to both the source and target creatures.

      </p>

      <p>This power cannot be used to transfer a power that cannot apply to the
      target creature. For instance, <em>hold person </em>cannot be moved to an
      outsider (because <em>hold person </em>can only target humanoids).
      <em>Retarget power </em>is, however, usable in cases of immunity, for
      instance allowing you to move mind-affecting spells or powers onto undead.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment: </strong>For every additional two power points you
      spend, the DC of this power is increased by 1.
