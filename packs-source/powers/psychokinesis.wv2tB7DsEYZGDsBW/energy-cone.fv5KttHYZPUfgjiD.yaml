      <p>You create a cone of energy of your active energy type (cold,
      electricity, fire, or sonic), extending outward from your hand, that deals
      5d6 points of damage to every creature or object within the area.

      </p><ul><li><em>Cold:</em> A cone of this energy type deals +1 point of
      damage per die. The saving throw to reduce damage from a cold cone is a
      Fortitude save instead of a Reflex save.</li></ul>

      <ul><li><em>Electricity:</em> Manifesting a cone of this energy type
      provides a +2 bonus to the save DC and a +2 bonus on manifester level
      checks for the purpose of overcoming power resistance.</li></ul>

      <ul><li><em>Fire:</em> A cone of this energy type deals +1 point of damage
      per die.</li></ul>

      <ul><li><em>Sonic:</em> A cone of this energy type deals –1 point of
      damage per die and ignores an object's hardness.</li></ul>

      <p>This power's subtype is the same as the type of energy you manifest.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every additional power point you spend,
      this power's damage increases by one die (d6). For each extra two dice of
      damage, this power's save DC increases by 1.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> A kineticist does not need to select an
      energy type for this power when he gains psionic focus. He may choose the
      type of damage at the time the power is manifested.
