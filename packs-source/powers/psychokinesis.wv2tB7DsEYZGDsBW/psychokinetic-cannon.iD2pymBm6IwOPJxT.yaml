        value: One piece of ammunition or one thrown weapon
  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You empower one piece of ammunition or one thrown weapon with the
      impetus of motion it would get from its launcher, in effect firing it by
      will alone. You may launch a boosted projectile as an attack action (in
      addition to the swift action of manifesting this power), treating it in
      all ways as if it had been fired from its intended launcher (shortbow,
      light crossbow, or sling, sized appropriately to you). Since no actual
      launcher is involved, reload times are not applicable. Making a ranged
      attack in this fashion does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

      </p>

      <p>The attack deals 1d8 points of damage regardless of ammunition type or
      size, has a range increment of 80 ft., and has a critical threat of 19-20
      and a x3 critical multiplier. Any feats or other abilities that work only
      on specific weapons work if the ammunition type is applicable to the
      ability (Improved Critical (longbow) for an arrow, for example).

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> You may augment this power in one or more of
      the following ways:

      </p><ol><li>If you spend an additional 2 power points, you may fire
      additional projectiles in this fashion as a full attack, up to the number
      of attacks you could normally make during a full attack action. These are
      not in addition to normal attacks in a full attack.</li><li>For every 4
      additional power points you spend, the attack gains a +1 enhancement bonus
      to attack and damage and a +10' bonus to range.</li></ol>
