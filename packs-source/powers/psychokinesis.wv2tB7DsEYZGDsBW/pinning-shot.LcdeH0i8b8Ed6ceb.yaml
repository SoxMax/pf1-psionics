      <p>Your arrows glisten with a thin layer of what appears to be an exotic
      psionic adhesive. While you have this power manifested, you fire shots
      that can bind targets in a number of ways. You can use this to make it
      difficult to open a door or similar portal, or to make it difficult for a
      creature to move.

      </p>

      <p><em>Creature: </em>To use this binding method, you must first
      successfully make a shot with a ranged weapon against your target. If you
      hit, instead of dealing damage as normal, you may choose to pin them to an
      adjacent object, including the floor. If there is no suitable adjacent
      object (such as in the case of a flying creature), this method has no
      effect. A target pinned to a solid object is unable to move from their
      location without succeeding at a Strength check with a DC equal to 13 +
      your key ability modifier.

      </p>

      <p><em>Door: </em>To use this binding method, you must first successfully
      make a shot with a ranged weapon against your target. A door, chest, or
      similar items typically have AC 10. If you hit, your projectile binds the
      portal shut, rendering it difficult to open. Opening such a bound item
      requires a Strength check with a DC equal to 13 + your key ability
      modifier.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment: </strong>For every additional two power points you
      spend, this power’s DC increases by 1.
