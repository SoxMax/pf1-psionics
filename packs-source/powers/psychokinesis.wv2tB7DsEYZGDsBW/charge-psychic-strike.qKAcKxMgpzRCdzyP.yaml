      <p>You quickly channel energy from your power pool into your mind blade to
      create a psychokinetic charge which is released as a free action as part
      of an attack. This charge inflicts an additional 1d8 points of damage.This
      functions exactly like the psychic strike class feature and may be used to
      power blade skills or feats that require the expenditure of the gifted
      blade's psychic strike.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every 4 power points spent, this
      psychokinetic charge inflicts an additional 1d8 points of damage. If you
      spend 8 or more power points on manifesting this power, you may manifest
      it as a swift action.
