      <p>If you have a claw attack (either from an actual natural weapon or from
      an effect such as claws of the beast), you can use this power to energize
      that weapon. The claw attack deals an extra 1d6 points of cold,
      electricity, or fire damage (as chosen by you when you choose your active
      energy type) on a successful hit. On a critical hit, it deals an extra
      1d10 points of energy damage. If the claw's critical multiplier is x3, add
      2d10 points of energy damage instead; if the multiplier is x4, add 3d10
      points of energy damage.

      </p>

      <p>This power can be manifested on a claw attack that already deals energy
      damage, but if the claw already deals the same type of damage as the
      power, the effects stack. If this power is manifested on a claw attack
      already benefiting from the effect of the power, the newer manifestation
      supersedes the older manifestation, even if both manifestations are of
      different energy types.

      </p>

      <p>This power's subtype is the same as the type of energy infused in the
      natural weapon.
