          Four 5-ft. squares of loose earth, sand, snow, or similar unworked
          terrain (S)
  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A quick burst of psychokinetic force rearranges the land nearby you,
      providing an emergency source of cover. By pushing the terrain away from a
      central point and piling it at the outer edges of the area of effect, you
      can rapidly create a mundane safe-zone for sudden combat.

      </p>

      <p>This power creates a small burrow three to five feet deep in the land,
      with a small wall that surrounds it which can provide cover for creatures
      within.

      </p>

      <p>Multiple manifestations of this power can dig deeper into the ground,
      providing a quick underground burrow, or can be used to extend an existing
      burrow into a trench. Foxhole cannot be used to dig through walls or
      foundations (although it could burrow around them) nor can it rearrange
      magically treated terrain.

      </p>

      <p>If the area of effect completely contains a creature's space, including
      the manifester, that creature must make a Reflex save or fall prone in the
      burrow. If a creature happens to be burrowing in the area of effect and
      would be exposed by this power, it emerges, prone but unharmed, in the
      trench.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> You may augment this power in one or more of
      the following ways:

      </p><ol><li>For each additional power point spend, you can burrow one
      5-ft, cube instead of affecting four 5ft. squares. Only one of these cubes
      need be in contact with the surface when you start
      manifesting.</li><li>For each 2 additional power points spend, you can
      affect substances with an hardness of 2 additional points (such as stone
      or ice) starting at hardness 0.</li><li>If you spend 2 additional power
      points you may manifest this power as a swift action.</li></ol>
