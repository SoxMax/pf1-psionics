      <p>By manipulating the ambient light level, you can decrease or increase
      the illumination of an area. The change in illumination can be gradual
      (taking as long as 1 minute) or sudden (occurring immediately when you
      manifest this power). You can alter the level of illumination from its
      original level at any time during the power's duration.

      </p><ul><li><em>Decrease:</em> You can decrease the light level of an area
      by one step (from bright light to normal light, from normal light to dim
      light, or from dim light to darkness. Creatures with darkvision can see in
      an area of dim light or darkness without penalty. You cannot create
      supernatural dark.</li></ul>

      <ul><li><em>Increase:</em> You can increase the light level of an area by
      one step (from darkness to dim light, from dim light to normal light, or
      from normal light to bright light).</li></ul>

      <ul><li><em>Burst Increase:</em> You can use this power to increase the
      light level of an area by two steps (from darkness to normal light, or
      from dim light to bright light), but in such a case the power's duration
      is only 1 round.</li></ul>

      <p>This power cannot stack with itself, even when manifested by another
      psionic creature, if manifested into the same area. If multiple
      manifestations of the control light power overlaps in an area, the light
      level is decreased or increased by only one step (or two steps in case of
      the Burst Increase manifestation).
