      <p>Like the spectral undead, you attune your senses to the heartbeats of
      the living. You gain blindsight with a range of 60 ft. However, any target
      that does not have a heartbeat (undead, constructs, some aberrations,
      etc.) is treated as having total concealment from your blindsight. Your
      normal senses continue to function.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> You may augment this power in one of the
      following ways.

      </p><ol><li>You may spend an additional 2 power points to increase the
      range of your blindsight from this power by 10 feet.</li><li>By spending
      an additional 4 power points, the duration of this power becomes 1
      hour/level.</li></ol>
