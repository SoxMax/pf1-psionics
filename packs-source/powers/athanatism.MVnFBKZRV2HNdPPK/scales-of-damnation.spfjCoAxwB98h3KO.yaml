      <p>By binding yourself to the spirit world, you can send power to it, or
      draw its power into yourself. While this power is active, you may, as a
      standard action, either give or drain energy from the spirit world. When
      you give energy to the spirit world, you may expend any amount of hit
      points. You extend the duration of this power by 1 round for every 2 hit
      points you lose this way. When you drain energy from the spirit world, you
      gain a +2 insight bonus to AC and all saving throws until you give energy
      to the spirit world.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> This power may be augmented in one of the
      following ways.

      </p><ol><li>By spending an additional 6 power points, you gain temporary
      power points equal to twice your Charisma modifier whenever you drain
      energy from the spirit world. These power points disappear when the power
      ends, and may not spent for this power or its augments.</li><li>You may
      spend an additional 2 power points and lose 5 hit points to increase the
      insight bonus to AC and saving throws by 1.</li></ol>
