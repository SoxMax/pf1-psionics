      <p>You force a target to share in the pain felt by nearby spirits. While
      the duration lasts, the target takes all damage and heals all wounds that
      any incorporeal or ethereal creature within 30 feet of them takes. The
      target is also subject to magical and psionic effects of 3rd level or
      lower that target or effect any incorporeal or ethereal creature within 30
      feet of them. If the effect offers a saving throw, the target gains one as
      well.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> You may augment this power in one of the
      following ways.

      </p><ol><li>You may spend an additional 2 power points to have this power
      affect one additional target and have its DC increased by 1.</li><li>For
      every additional 4 power points spent, the maximum level of effects that
      are shared between the target and nearby incorporeal or ethereal creatures
      is increased by 1. For example, if you augment this power twice in this
      way, the target will be subject to magical or psionic effects of 5th level
      or lower that target or effect any incorporeal of ethereal creatures
      within 30 feet instead of 3rd or lower.</li></ol>
