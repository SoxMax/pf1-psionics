      <p>The smell of rancid, rotting vegetation suffuses the area as the object
      of your ire rapidly ages and falls apart. When you manifest this power,
      you must make a ranged touch attack (typically AC 10) against a single
      magical or psionic consumable item such as a potion, scroll, shard, or
      power stone. The object targeted must make a successful saving throw or it
      is immediately broken. If the item is unattended, use its manifester level
      as its Will saving throw bonus. If the item is attended, use the Will
      saving throw bonus of the creature holding it.

      </p>

      <p>This power cannot be normally be used against items that contain more
      than one charge, such as wands or dorjes. In the case of items such as
      scrolls that are single-use but contain more than one spell or power, one
      randomly chosen spell or power can be ruined per manifestation of
      <em>accelerated entropy</em>.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment: </strong>If you spend 2 additional power points, you
      can target a single, non-magical item weighing up to 10 pounds per
      manifester level. In addition, for every two additional power points you
      spend, the saving throw DC increases by 1.
