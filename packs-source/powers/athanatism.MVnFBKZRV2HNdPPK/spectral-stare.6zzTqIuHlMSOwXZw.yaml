      <p>You emulate the horrific gaze attacks of the spectral dead, causing
      corruption with a glance. As a standard action as long as this power's
      effects persist, you may direct your spectral stare at a creature or
      object within 30 feet of your location. Targeted creatures must succeed at
      a Fortitude save or suffer 2d10 points of damage and 1d4 Charisma damage.
      A successful save negates the Charisma damage but not the physical damage.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> You may augment this power in one of the
      following ways.

      </p><ol><li>By spending an additional 4 power points, you expend your
      psionic focus when directing your gaze at a creature to grant them 1d4
      negative levels instead of Charisma damage. They may negate this by
      succeeding at a Fortitude save. This is a death effect.</li><li>For every
      4 additional power points spent, you deal an additional 1d10 damage points
      of damage, as well as an additional point of Charisma damage to those that
      fail the save.</li></ol>

      <p>In addition, for every two power points spent augmenting this power,
      increase the power's save DC by 1.
