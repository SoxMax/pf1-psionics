      target:
        value: You and one other corporeal undead creature
  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You can attempt to take control of a nearby corporeal undead creature,
      forcing your mind and soul into its body, and its mind into your body. You
      can target any creature whose Hit Dice are equal to or less than your
      manifester level.

      </p>

      <p>You possess the target's body and force the creature's mind into your
      body unless it succeeds on a Will save. You can move your mind back into
      your own body whenever you desire, which returns the subject's mind to its
      own body and ends the power. If the manifestation succeeds, your life
      force occupies the host body, and the host's life force takes over yours.

      </p>

      <p>You can call on rudimentary or instinctive knowledge of the subject
      creature, but not upon its acquired or learned knowledge (such as skills
      and feats it possesses). The same is true for the subject in your body -
      mindless undead or undead with no Intelligence score will usually take no
      actions unless ordered to. The mind switch brings about the following
      changes.

      </p><ul><li>You count as undead for all purposes, gaining standard undead
      immunities.</li><li>You gain the Strength and Dexterity scores of your
      assumed body.</li><li>You gain the natural armor, natural attacks,
      movement, and other simple physical characteristics of your assumed
      body.</li><li>You gain the extraordinary special attacks and qualities of
      your assumed body, but you do not gain supernatural or spell-like
      abilities.</li><li>You gain the possessions and equipment of your assumed
      body.</li><li>You retain your own hit points, saving throws (possibly
      modified by new ability scores), class abilities, supernatural and
      psi-like abilities, spells and powers, and skills and feats (although
      skill checks use your new ability scores, and you may be temporarily
      unable to use feats whose requirements you do not meet in your new
      body).</li><li>You suffer one negative level while in your assumed
      body.</li></ul>

      <p>Supernatural abilities that require a certain body part may be
      unavailable in your new form.

      </p>

      <p>If either body is killed while the power is in effect, the other
      participant also dies when the power ends. If one participant's body
      becomes petrified, imprisoned by temporal stasis or imprisonment, or
      incapacitated in some other way, the other participant will be
      incapacitated in that way when the power ends.

      </p>

      <p>A targeted dispel psionics (or similar spells or effects) successfully
      manifested on either participant causes both minds to return to their
      original bodies.

      </p>

      <p>If you successfully use foot in the grave while already under the
      effect of foot in the grave, the original target is returned to its
      original body, the new target occupies your original body, and you occupy
      the body of the new target.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> This power may be augmented in one of the
      following ways.

      </p><ol><li>By spending 6 additional power points, you may expend your
      psionic focus while this power is active to attempt to take control of a
      different corporeal undead body. You may do this as many times as you wish
      while this power is active, but must expend your psionic focus each time
      to do so. Whenever you leave a body in this way, the original target is
      returned to its body.</li><li>By spending 4 additional power points,
      increase the duration of this power to 1 hour/level.</li></ol>
