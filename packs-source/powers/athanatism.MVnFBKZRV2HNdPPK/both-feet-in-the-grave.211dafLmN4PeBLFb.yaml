      <p>As <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf1-psionics.powers.Item.AELdoAZObvZ4xKUp]{Foot
      in the Grave}</em>, except as noted here. You permanently exchange bodies
      with the subject. Since this power's duration is instantaneous, you cannot
      be forced to return to your natural body by means of
      <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf1-psionics.powers.Item.VtCyfby7BYjzVDrL]{dispel
      psionics}</em>, an
      <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.niqxt53lhxrjfaty]{Antimagic
      Field}</em>, or a similar effect. If the subject's body dies while you are
      in it, you are dead. The subject immediately suffers one permanent
      negative level, but otherwise survives the experience in your natural
      body. If your natural body dies while the subject is in it, you
      immediately suffer two permanent negative levels, but you likewise survive
      the experience in your new body. Negative levels gained in this way may
      only be cured by powerful healing, such as cleanse spirit, greater
      restoration or restoration; they do not fade over time.

      </p>

      <p>Your "natural" body is always considered to be the last one you
      switched out of. If you exchange bodies with a chain of multiple subjects,
      you need worry only about the welfare of the last body you switched with.
      In other words, if your mind is expelled from your current body, your mind
      returns to the last body you switched with, not to your original body.
      Similarly, if your original body dies but you have since switched minds
      with a second subject, you take no penalty. You suffer permanent negative
      levels only if the body you inhabited immediately prior to your current
      body is killed.

      </p>

      <p>You suffer two temporary negative levels upon manifesting this power,
      as your mind adjusts to controlling a new body. These negative levels
      cannot be cured, but fade at a rate of one every 24 hours.

      </p>

      <p>If you successfully use both feet in the grave while under the effect
      of foot in the grave, the original target of foot in the grave is returned
      to its original body, the new target of both feet in the grave occupies
      your original body, and you occupy the body of the target of both feet in
      the grave.
