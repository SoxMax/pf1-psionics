      <p>You summon ethereal implements to lash and torment the incorporeal.
      This power deals 5d8 damage to the target; this damage is not reduced by
      the incorporeal trait.

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> This power may be augmented in one of the
      following ways.

      </p><ol><li>For every one additional power point you spend, the power
      deals an additional 1d8 damage.</li><li>By spending an additional 4 power
      points, you may wrack all targets hit with pain. If they fail the
      Fortitude save, they are also sickened for 1d6 rounds. This special use of
      the sickened condition affects incorporeal undead normally, regardless of
      any immunity they may have.</li><li>By spending an additional 4 power
      points, this power affects all incorporeal creatures in a 20-ft.-radius
      spread, instead of only a single target.</li></ol>

      <p>In addition, for every 2 power points spent augmenting this power,
      increase the power's save DC by 1.
