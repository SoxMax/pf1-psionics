    value: >-
      <p>This power functions exactly like
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1-psionics.powers.Item.RSTn1puvfEncgg7a]{Gift of the
      Corpse}, except that you become similar to a ghost instead of a shadow,
      gaining the following changes for as long as this power is active: you
      become incorporeal, count as undead for all purposes (including immunities
      and vulnerabilities), gain a +4 enhancement bonus to Charisma, a
      deflection bonus to your AC equal to your Charisma modifier, temporary hit
      points equal to your manifester level, and channel resistance +4. While in
      this state, you cannot benefit from any gear you possess unless it has the
      ghost touch special property.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> You may spend 4 additional power points to
      have your body temporarily vanish when you manifest this power. If you do
      so, your body is immune to all damage and effects until this power ends,
      when it reappears wherever it was originally.
