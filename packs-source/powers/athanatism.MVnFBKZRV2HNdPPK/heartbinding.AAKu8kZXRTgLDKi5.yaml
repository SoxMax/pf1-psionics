      <p>By binding the soul of another to yourself, you form a protective bond.
      The subject gains a +1 deflection bonus to AC and a +1 resistance bonus on
      saves. While this power is active, you or the target may choose to gain
      any morale bonuses granted to the other, just as if you were both
      targeted. In addition, if you or the target are subjected to an emotion
      effect that allows a saving throw, one of you may attempt the saving
      throw, applying the result to both of you. You must decide to use this
      effect before the save is made.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> By spending an additional 6 power points, you
      may, as a standard action, end this power to heal the target 3d8 points of
      damage + 1 point per manifester level (maximum +25). This healing can
      return a recently dead target to life, as long as its hit points after the
      healing are at least equal to the hit points at which it would die. If you
      return a recently dead target to life this way, you suffer damage equal to
      the amount healed. You must touch the target to trigger this effect, and
      no more than one round may have passed since their death. This power gains
      the healing subtype.
