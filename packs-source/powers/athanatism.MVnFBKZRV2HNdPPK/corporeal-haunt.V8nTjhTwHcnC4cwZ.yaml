      <p>By binding spiritual essence into an area, you effectively create a
      haunt. When you create this haunt, you may create a haunt from the table
      below with a ML of 7 or lower. Regardless of the haunt, it always acts on
      an initiative count of 0. When you haunt an area in this way, it takes on
      minor characteristics specific to the haunt (for example, ghostly hallways
      for the orbs haunt, or a spectral churchyard for the mad monk haunt). You
      are immune to all effects of this haunt. An area can receive only one
      corporeal haunt power at a time.

      </p><ul><li><em>Slamming Portal:</em> LE haunt (doors or shutters in 5-ft.
      radius); ML 1; Perception DC 10 (to see a portal closing); hp 2; tricked
      by hide from undead. The haunted door or window slams shut, held fast as
      if by hold portal for 1 minute or until the haunt is destroyed.</li></ul>

      <ul><li><em>Orbs:</em> CE haunt (10-ft.-by-20-ft; hallway); ML 2;
      Perception DC 10 (to notice pulsating, glowing orbs); hp 4; destroyed by
      slow effect. This swarm of glowing orbs, ranging in size from tiny peas to
      large melons, cause witnesses to be subjected to the effects of scare (DC
      13).</li></ul>

      <ul><li><em>Cold Spot:</em> NE persistent haunt (15-ft. radius); ML 3;
      Perception DC 10 (to notice sudden temperature drop); hp 13; damaged by
      fire. When the area is entered, the temperature immediately drops to
      freezing, drawing warmth from the living. This duplicates chill touch (DC
      11), automatically affecting all creatures in the area for each round they
      remain.</li></ul>

      <ul><li><em>Choking Hands:</em> CE persistent haunt (15-ft.-by-30-ft.;
      alleyway); ML 4; Perception DC 20 (to see coalescing vapor); hp 18;
      tricked by hide from undead. This spirit manifests as a pair of spectral
      skeletal hands, latching on to the throats of the victim. This +4 touch
      attack duplicates a vampiric touch each round, adding the temporary hit
      points to the haunt's hp total.</li></ul>

      <ul><li><em>Mad Monk:</em> CN haunt (25-ft.-radius; churchyard); ML 5;
      Perception DC 20 (to hear pouring liquid); hp 10. A robed monk
      materializes, offering a gold chalice to a target in the area. There is a
      50% chance that the liquid within functions as a cure critical wounds -
      otherwise, it functions as the poison spell (DC 16). The haunt ends as
      soon as one creature drinks from the chalice.</li></ul>

      <ul><li><em>Baleful Apparition:</em> CE haunt (30-ft.-by-30-ft.; chamber);
      ML 6; Perception DC 18 (to feel an ominous presence); hp 12. Victims of
      the haunt are subject to disturbing, phantasmal images. These unnatural
      sights and sounds cause all in the area to be affected as if by fear (DC
      16).</li></ul>

      <ul><li><em>Deathless Defenders:</em> CE haunt (30-ft. radius); ML 7;
      Perception DC 20 (to see spectral image of a decayed regiment); hp 14;
      tricked by hide from undead. Appearing as regiments of spectral, decaying
      warriors, these haunts charge those in the area bearing rusting arms and
      armor. These attacks mimic the effects of eyebite (DC 19).</li></ul>

      <ul><li><em>Ghastly Whispers:</em> CE haunt (up to 40-ft. radius); ML 8;
      Perception DC 20 (to hear whispers growing louder); hp 16. Those in the
      area can hear a faint whispering, growing louder and louder. This
      maddening disorientation functions as an insanity (DC 20).</li></ul>

      <ul><li><em>Ectoplasmic Miasma:</em> CE persistent haunt (30-ft. radius;
      ethereal cloud); ML 9; Perception DC 15 (to see congealing mist); hp 40;
      tricked by hide from undead. Dozens of spectral visages appear, howling
      and twisting, in the fog, their limbs and faces mangled. These figures
      pass through those in the area, duplicating both solid fog and acid fog
      (DC 17), except that they deal untyped damage.</li></ul>

      <ul><li><em>Headless Horseman:</em> CE persistent haunt (10-ft.-by-50.
      ft.; bridge); ML 10; Perception DC 20 (to hear the galloping of a phantom
      horse); hp 45. This haunt appears as a headless, mounted rider, wearing
      ancient armor, head swinging from the saddle of its rotting horse. Every
      round, it gallops by, attacking a target within the area as if with mage's
      sword (with a +16 attack bonus).</li></ul>

      <ul><li><em>Spectral Carriage:</em> CE haunt (15-ft.-by-60-ft.; roadway);
      ML 11; Perception DC 22 (to hear galloping hooves); hp 22. Appearing as a
      translucent horse-drawn carriage, full of laughing ghosts in rotting
      finery, this haunt swerves to run down all the area. This functions as a
      clenched fist (+25 attack), affecting every target in the area.</li></ul>

      <ul><li><em>Hungry Earth:</em> CE haunt (80-ft.-radius; graveyard); ML 12;
      Perception DC 29 (to feel the ground shift); hp 24. Deep, yawning graves
      open in the earth beneath each target in the area, functioning as an
      earthquake cast on open ground (DC 15 or 20). Victims that fall into the
      grave are buried as normal until they free themselves or are
      recovered.</li></ul>

      <ul><li><em>Gjenganger:</em> CE persistent haunt (up to 65-ft. radius); ML
      13; Perception 28 (to see the haunt becoming corporeal); hp 58. The
      gjenganger manifests corporeally, appearing as a twisted, stunted double
      of a target in the area. However it appears, the haunt relies on its "dead
      man's pinch", a +13 melee touch attack that causes bubonic plague, as if
      by contagion (DC 16).</li></ul>

      <ul><li><em>Keening Suicides:</em> CE haunt (60-ft.-radius; tower); ML 14;
      Perception DC 30 (to hear distant, plummeting screams); hp 28. This haunt
      appears with the awful wails of those leaping to their deaths from high
      atop the tower. These wails overwhelm the living, filling them with lethal
      sorrow. This functions as a wail of the banshee (DC 23) to all within the
      area.</li></ul>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every 2 additional power points you
      spend, increase the possible ML of the haunt by 1, to a maximum of your
      manifester level.
