      <p>You and a group of allies summon pieces of a departed soul for
      questioning. You may include up to two others in this power as members,
      whom you must remain in close proximity to for the entire manifestation
      time. When you manifest this power, you must specify a departed soul by
      name. That departed soul is the target, and can be targeted on different
      planes. The departed soul is physically drawn to your location, and cannot
      take any actions while there except to communicate. It is not an actual
      creature, and cannot be attacked or effected in any way. You and each
      other that aided you in the manifestation of this power may each ask the
      departed soul a question, which the departed soul must answer though it
      only knows what it knew in life. The departed soul can be deceptive or
      cryptic, if it so wishes.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> You may augment this power in one of the
      following ways.

      </p><ol><li>For every 2 additional power points spent, you can include an
      additional member in the manifestation of this power.</li><li>By spending
      an additional 8 power points, you may target a departed soul that has been
      destroyed in the last week.</li></ol>
