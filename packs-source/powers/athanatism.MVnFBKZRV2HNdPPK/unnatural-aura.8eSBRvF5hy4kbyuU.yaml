      <p>You cause the target to radiate the unnatural chill of the grave,

      approach within 20 feet of the target. If they fail the save and are
      forced to approach, they are shaken for as long as they remain within 20
      feet of the target.

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> This power may be augmented in one of the
      following ways.

      </p><ol><li>For every additional power point spent, you can target one
      additional living creature when manifesting this power.</li><li>By
      spending an additional 4 power points, you may cause any animal that fails
      the save and is forced to approach to become frightened.</li><li>By
      spending an additional 6 power points, you may cause any animal that fails
      the save and is forced to approach to become panicked.</li></ol>

      <p>In addition, for every two power points spent augmenting this power,
      increase the power's save DC by 1.
