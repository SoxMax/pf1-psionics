      <p>You devour the most delectable parts of the souls of the fallen. The
      target must have been dead no more than 1 round per manifester level. You
      gain a soul pool, with soul points equal to the target's HD plus its
      Charisma modifier. You may spend one or more soul points from this pool to
      grant yourself one of the following bonuses: heal a point of ability
      damage (this costs 3 soul points), heal a point of ability drain (this
      costs 5 soul points), heal a negative level (7 soul points), or gain
      temporary hit points equal to the target's HD (1 soul point). Spending
      soul points from a soul pool is always a free action.

      </p>

      <p>The soul pool and any bonuses or temporary hit points granted by this
      power vanish at the end of the day. In addition, anyone attempting to
      return a target of this power to life or raise a target of this power as
      an undead creature must succeed on an opposed manifester level check with
      you – if they fail, the attempt fails. If you manifest this power while
      you have soul points in your soul pool (such as from a previous
      manifestation of this power), the previous soul pool is emptied, and all
      bonuses or temporary hit points gained from it are immediately lost.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> You may augment this power in one of the
      following ways.

      </p><ol><li>You may spend an additional 2 power points to share this feast
      with one ally that is also adjacent to the target. That ally gains
      temporary hit points equal to the target's HD. These temporary hit points
      vanish at the end of the day.</li><li>By spending an additional 2 power
      points, while you have one or more soul points from this power, you gain a
      bonus on saves against negative energy, death effects, and energy drain
      equal to the target's Charisma modifier.</li></ol>
