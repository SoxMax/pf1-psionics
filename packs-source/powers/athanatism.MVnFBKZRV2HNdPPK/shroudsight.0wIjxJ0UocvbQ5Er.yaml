      <p>You attune your eyes to the energies of the dead and the half-living,
      detecting undead and incorporeal creatures. The amount of information
      revealed depends on how long you study a particular area.

      </p><ul><li><em>1st Round:</em> Presence or absence of undead or
      incorporeal auras.</li></ul>

      <ul><li><em>2nd Round:</em> Number of incorporeal or undead auras in the
      area and the strength of the strongest incorporeal or undead aura present.
      If you are of good alignment, and the strongest incorporeal or undead
      aura's strength is overwhelming (11 HD or greater), and the creature has
      HD of at least twice your character level, you are stunned for 1 round and
      the power ends.</li></ul>

      <ul><li><em>3rd Round:</em> The strength and location of each incorporeal
      or undead aura. If an aura is outside your line of sight, then you discern
      its direction but not its exact location.</li></ul>

      <p>Each round, you can turn to detect incorporeal creatures or undead in a
      new area. The power can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of
      common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.

      </p>

      <p>For the purpose of detecting incorporeal undead, you count as if you
      had spent three rounds focusing whenever you manifest this power,
      automatically granting you the maximum amount of information.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> By spending an additional 3 power points,
      gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls, power save DCs, and skill checks against
      any creatures that you detected with this power. This bonus lasts for a
      number of rounds equal to your key manifesting modifier.
