      <p>You transform phantasmal remains into a sumptuous, macabre banquet,
      which you may share with one creature/level. The feast takes 1 hour to
      consume, and the beneficial effects do not set in until this hour is over.
      Every creature partaking of the feast gains 1d8 temporary hit points + 1
      point per two manifester levels (maximum +10). The meat of the feast
      grants each target that partakes a +2 morale bonus on saving throws
      against curses and effects that sicken or nauseate for 12 hours. If the
      feast is interrupted for any reason, the power is ruined and all effects
      of the power are negated.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> You may spend an 6 additional power points to
      grant all who join in the feast a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls. It also
      increases the granted bonus on saves against curses and effects that
      sicken or nauseate to +4. In addition, if you expend your psionic focus
      when manifesting this power, you may provide both of the following
      benefits to any that partake in the feast: dispel any magical or psionic
      effects reducing one of the subject's ability scores, cures 1d4 points of
      temporary ability damage to one of the subject's ability scores,
      eliminates fatigue, improves an exhausted condition to fatigued, and
      attempts to remove any curses currently affecting the creature. You must
      succeed at a manifester level check against the DC of each curse, with
      success meaning that the curse is removed.
