      <p>By imbuing a shadow with psychic energy, you create a free-willed and
      friendly spirit. You create a harmless shadow spirit to serve your needs.
      This spirit is treated as a shadow, except that it cannot attack or take
      hostile actions and has a friendly disposition towards you. You may use it
      to scout, but it cannot venture more than 50 feet from you without
      vanishing, and it cannot speak (though it can communicate through mime or
      shadow puppetry). The shadow will generally follow your commands, unless
      you command it to do something obviously self-destructive. It also suffers
      a -2 penalty on saves against any athanatism powers that you manifest on
      it.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> By spending an additional 6 power points,
      increase the duration of this power to 1 hour/level.
