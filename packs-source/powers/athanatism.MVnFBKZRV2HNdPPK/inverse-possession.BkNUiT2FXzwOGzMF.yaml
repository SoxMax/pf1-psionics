        value: One incorporeal creature

    value: >-
      <p>You draw an incorporeal creature Into your body, where you are free to
      draw on it for power. The target is immune to all damage and effects while
      this power is active, and it cannot take actions or do anything but
      communicate with you. As a free action, once per HD the incorporeal
      creature possesses, you may increase the DC of a conduit power you
      manifest by 1. This power ends once you have gained the above bonus a
      number of times equal to the HD of the incorporeal creature. You may only
      have one instance of this power active at a time. When this power ends,
      the incorporeal creature is returned from whence it came.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> You may augment this power in one of the
      following ways.

      </p><ol><li>By spending an additional 2 power points, you may make this
      power incredibly draining for the target. When the power ends, the target
      suffers a penalty to attack rolls, damage rolls, and skill checks equal to
      the number of times you activated this power. This penalty lasts for half
      as long as this power was active. For example Deren targets a 10-HD
      creature with this power. He uses the power's bonus ten times in the
      following six rounds, ending it early. The creature receives a -10 penalty
      on attack rolls, damage rolls, and skill checks for 3 rounds, since 3 is
      half of the number of rounds it was affected by this power.</li><li>By
      spending an additional 2 power points, you may drain the creature of
      power. Instead of increasing the DC of a conduit power you manifest, you
      may gain a number of temporary power points equal to your Charisma
      modifier. These temporary power points vanish 5 minutes after this power
      ends.</li></ol>
