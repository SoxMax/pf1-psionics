  description:
    value: >-
      <p>By wracking a incorporeal creature with incredible pain and suffering,
      you attempt to transform it into a wraith. The target is stunned for the
      duration of this power. It can attempt a new save at the end of each of
      its turns to end this effect – but it receives a penalty on this save
      equal to the number of rounds it has been stunned (for example, the
      target's second save is at a -2, the third at a -3, and so on to a maximum
      of -5 for the fifth save). If all five rounds pass and the target is still
      stunned by this power, it is immediately destroyed, returning as a wraith
      in 1d4 rounds. You gain no special control or influence over this wraith –
      in fact, it is likely to be enraged towards you for the pain you caused
      it. However, a wraith created through this power suffers a permanent
      penalty on saves equal to your Charisma modifier against athanatism powers
      or effects you create.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> You may spend an additional 2 power points to
      have this power target a corporeal creature within range.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> Though this is a death effect, incorporeal
      undead creatures gain no immunity against this power.
