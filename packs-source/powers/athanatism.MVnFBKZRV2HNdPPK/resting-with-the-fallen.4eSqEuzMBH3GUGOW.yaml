    value: >-
      <p>You transfer your soul into a dead body, claiming their

      memories as your own. When you manifest this power, your body is emptied –
      you are treated as unconscious and helpless. However, as you are not
      within your body, you are immune to mind-affecting effects for this time.
      While this power is active, you may dredge through the target's most
      recent memories. For each round that you remain in the target's mind (up
      to 1 round/level), you access two rounds worth of memory. These memories
      start from immediately before the target died, and continue backwards from
      there (for example, if you were in their mind for 4 rounds, you would
      learn the last 8 rounds of their memories prior to death). You only learn
      anything they experienced or learned in that time period.

      </p>

      <p>If the target's body is destroyed, raised from the dead, or animated as
      undead while you are in it, this power immediately ends, and you must
      succeed at a Will save or be dazed for 1d6 rounds.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> You may augment this power in one of the
      following ways.

      </p><ol><li>By spending an additional 6 power points, you instead gain
      access to 1 hour of memories for each round you spend in the target's
      mind.</li><li>By spending an additional 6 power points, you may corrupt
      any memories you access, changing them subtly in ways you choose. This
      affects any future manifestations of this or other similar effects on the
      target, as well as affecting the target's memories should they be later
      raised or become undead.</li><li>By spending an additional 4 power points,
      you may animate the body. While this power is active, the dead body is
      treated as a wight, completely under your control.</li></ol>
