    value: >-
      <p>You temporarily infuse an undead creature with life energy. The undead
      creature touched must succeed at a Will save or it becomes infused with
      life, no longer undead. The target loses the undead type (do not change
      its HD, skills, or saves), regaining whatever its type was in life (if its
      original type is uncertain, it instead becomes a magical beast). Its
      Constitution score becomes 10 temporarily, but it continues to use
      Charisma to determine hit points and bonus added to Fortitude saves. If it
      was mindless, it remains mindless. It also loses all undead immunities,
      channel resistance, and any energy drain abilities it may have possessed.
      If it was incorporeal, it loses the incorporeal subtype and grows a
      temporary body similar to the one it had in life, except that it has a
      Strength score of 10. It also becomes sensitive to pain. Whenever is
      suffers an amount of damage equal to or greater than its HD, it must
      succeed at a Will save or become sickened for one round.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> By spending an additional 6 power points and
      expending your psionic focus, you may allow this power to become
      contagious. The next undead creature that the target touches is subjected
      to a second manifestation of this power, including all augments and other
      enhancements. This second manifestation costs you no additional power
      points and does not require you to expend your psionic focus.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> If this power is manifested on a willing
      target, the duration becomes 10 min./level and they do not suffer the
      sensitivity to pain.
