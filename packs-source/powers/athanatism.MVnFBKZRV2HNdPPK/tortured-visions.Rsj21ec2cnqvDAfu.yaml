      <p>You summon the spectral horrors of the Ethereal Plane to haunt the
      dreams of a specific creature that you name or otherwise specifically
      designate. These tortured visions prevent restful sleep and cause 1d10
      points of damage. The tortured visions leave the subject fatigued and
      unable to regain arcane spells or power points for the next 24 hours.

      </p>

      <p>The difficulty of the save depends on your knowledge of the subject and
      the physical connection (if any) you have to that creature.

      <p>*You must have some sort of connection to a creature of which you have
      no knowledge.

      </p>

      <p>Dispel psionics manifested on the subject while you are manifesting
      this power dispels the tortured visions and causes you to be stunned for
      10 minutes per manifester level of the dispel psionics. If the recipient
      is awake when the power begins, you can choose to cease manifesting
      (ending the power) or to enter a trance until the recipient goes to sleep,
      whereupon you become alert again and complete the manifesting. If you are
      disturbed during the trance, you must succeed on a Concentration check as
      if you were in the midst of manifesting a power or the power ends.

      </p>

      <p>If you choose to enter a trance, you are not aware of your surroundings
      or the activities around you while in the trance. You are defenseless,
      both physically and mentally, while in the trance (you always fails Will
      saving throws, for example). Creatures who don't sleep (such as elves, but
      not half-elves) or dream are immune to this power.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> By spending an additional 4 power points, a
      creature that fails its save is haunted for 24 hours by imaginary
      creatures. The creature suffers a -2 penalty to all d20 rolls and is
      shaken. In addition, they may see into the Ethereal Plane within 20 feet
      of them.
