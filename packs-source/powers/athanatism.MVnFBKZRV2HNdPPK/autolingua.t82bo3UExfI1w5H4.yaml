      <p>You allow the spirit world access to your hands, gaining information on
      a person, place, or thing through their written words at the cost of some
      of your essence. If the person or thing is at hand, or if you are in the
      place in question, the casting time is 1d4 x 10 minutes. If you have only
      detailed information on the person, place, or thing, the casting time is
      1d10 days, and the resulting lore is less complete and specific (though it
      often provides enough information to help you find the person, place, or
      thing, thus allowing a better autolingua result next time). If you know
      only rumors, the casting time is 2d6 weeks, and the resulting lore is
      vague and incomplete (though it often directs you to more detailed
      information, thus allowing a better autolingua result next time).

      </p>

      <p>During the casting, you cannot engage in other than routine activities:
      eating, sleeping, and so forth. When completed, the written words bring
      legends (if any) about the person, place, or things to your mind. These
      may be legends that are still current, legends that have been forgotten,
      or even information that has never been generally known. If the person,
      place, or thing is not of legendary importance, you gain no information.
      As a rule of thumb, characters who are 11th level and higher are
      "legendary," as are the sorts of creatures they contend with, the major
      magic items they wield, and the places where they perform their key deeds.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> This power may be augmented in one of the
      following ways.

      </p><ol><li>By spending an additional 2 power points, you reduce the
      manifesting time of this power when the person, place, or thing is not at
      hand from 1d10 days to 1d10 hours.</li><li>By spending an additional 4
      power points, you reduce the manifesting time of this power when you know
      only rumors of the person, place, or thing from 2d6 weeks to 2d6
      days.</li><li>By spending an additional 4 power points, you create a map
      towards the person, place, or thing if it is not on hand. This map shows
      the shortest, most direct physical route to its location at the time you
      finish manifesting this power, as long as it is on the same plane as you.
      If you are not on the same plane as it, you instead learn which plane it
      is currently on.</li></ol>
