      <p>You reinforce the bond between a master and servant, allowing them to
      join in undeath. If the target's master dies and is animated as any kind
      of intelligent undead, the target immediately dies. They reanimate as a
      ghost, retaining all of the same benefits they had in life as a familiar
      or animal companion, including the bond to their master.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every additional power point spent, the
      maximum HD of creature that this power can target is increased by 1.
