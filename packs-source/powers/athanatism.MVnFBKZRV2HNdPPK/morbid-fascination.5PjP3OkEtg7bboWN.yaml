      <p>You cast your eyes far off into the Ethereal, catching occasional
      glimpses of its inhabitants. You can see creatures in the Ethereal Plane
      and pinpoint their locations, but they are treated as having total
      concealment from you. This link with the Ethereal makes you dangerously
      curious about the dead and ghosts. While this power is active; you gain a
      +2 bonus on Diplomacy checks made against followers or advocates of death
      and ghosts, but suffer a -2 penalty on Will saving throws and Bluff checks
      against the same.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> By spending an additional 4 power points, you
      may, as a swift action at any time during the duration of this power,
      expend your psionic focus to instead treat creatures in the Ethereal Plane
      as if they had concealment instead of total concealment for one round.
