    value: >-
      <p>Your powers can grant the final mercy to those suffering. The target
      dies immediately. Any triggered effects that would normally activate on
      the target's death do not activate, and the target cannot be raised from
      the dead by any means. A target killed by this power does not become
      undead when it dies. If the target is coerced or compelled in any way,
      this power fails.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> This power may be augmented in one of the
      following ways.

      </p><ol><li>You may expend your psionic focus to have only effects of your
      choice trigger when the target dies.</li><li>By spending an additional 10
      power points, the target does not have to be willing or conscious. This
      power has a range of touch, and the target receives a Fortitude save to
      resist its effects (as well as power resistance, if
      applicable).</li><li>By spending an additional 4 power points, the target
      can be a willing undead creature. The target is completely destroyed,
      releasing its soul to be raised as normal.</li></ol>

      <p>In addition, for every two power points spent augmenting this power,
      increase the power's save DC by 1.
