    value: >-
      <p>You exhale your life force temporarily, unbinding your spirit from your
      body. For the duration of this power, you lay in a deathlike comatose
      state.

      </p>

      <p>While this power is active, you gain a shadow's  darkvision, defensive
      abilities (including incorporeal), fly speed, racial Stealth modifier, and
      Strength damage attack. You do not gain the creature's create spawn
      ability, nor its skill ranks or Hit Dice. Your spirit has Hit Dice and hit
      points equal to your own. Your spirit has the undead type and may be
      turned or affected as undead. If your spirit is slain, you return to your
      physical body and are immediately reduced to -1 hit points. Your condition
      becomes dying, and you must begin making Constitution checks to stabilize.

      </p>

      <p>When this power ends, as long as your body has not been completely
      destroyed (such as through the effects of disintegrate) and is on the same
      plane of existence, you automatically return to it. If it is not, this
      power remains active except that if you have not reached your body after a
      number of minutes equal to your manifester level, your spirit dies
      instantly.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> This power may be augmented in one of the
      following ways.

      </p><ol><li>By spending an additional 2 power points, you may manifest
      this power on a willing creature that you touch.</li><li>By spending an
      additional 4 power points, you may manifest this power as an immediate
      action in response to being attacked. This has the added effect of making
      it appear that the triggering attack killed you.</li><li>By spending an
      additional 4 power points, the duration of this power doubles.</li></ol>
