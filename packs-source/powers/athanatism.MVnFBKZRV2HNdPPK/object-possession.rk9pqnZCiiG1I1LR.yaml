      <p>You take a ghostlike form, leaping into a nearby object. This object
      must be of Small size or smaller, and must be no further away than 50
      feet. You effectively become that object, counting as an animated object
      of the object's size and shape, except that you do not gain immunity to
      mind-affecting effects. If the object is destroyed while you are
      inhabiting it, this power immediately ends and you are dazed for one
      round.

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> This power may be augmented in one of the
      following was.

      </p><ol><li>By spending an additional 4 power points, increase the
      duration of this power to 10 minutes/level. However, if you augment the
      power in this way, the object targeted does not become animated - instead,
      you can take no action while inside it other than to dismiss this power.
      You may observe the object's surroundings using your skills and normal
      senses, however.</li><li>You may spend an additional 3 power points to
      increase the size of object you may animate by one step (to a maximum of
