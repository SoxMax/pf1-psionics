      <p>You rip the soul from another, killing them and turning the stolen
      essence into a ghost. This power deals 10 points of damage per manifester
      level to the target. If the target's Fortitude save succeeds, it instead
      takes 3d6 + 1 point/manifester level. If damage from this power kills the
      target, you may immediately animate their soul as a ghost that shares your
      alignment and motivations (and will generally be friendly towards you). In
      addition, the ghost suffers a permanent -2 penalty on saves against
      athanatism powers or effects that you manifest

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every two additional power points you
      spend, increase the save DC of this power by 1.
