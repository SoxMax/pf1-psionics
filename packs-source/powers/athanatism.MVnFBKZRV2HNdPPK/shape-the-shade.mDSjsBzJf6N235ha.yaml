      You may make the creature appear either living or dead, corporeal or
      incorporeal, and can even effect clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment.
      This power can make the target seem 1 foot shorter or taller, thin, fat,
      or in between. It can change the apparent subtype of the target, can add
      or obscure a minor feature, or make it look like an entirely different
      sex.

      form.. If this is used to create a disguise, the target gets a +10 bonus
