      <p>A shadowy silhouette of your hand reaches out from you and appears to
      spread a portion of your essence upon a nearby surface. This power allows
      you to cover a wall, floor, ceiling, or similar surface with energies that
      incorporeal undead find repulsive. Such creatures are unwilling to cross
      through this energy, making the area you ward impassable to them. You may
      shape the area you designate to some degree, but your ward always coats
      existing physical materials and you must be able to see the surfaces you
      intend to cover. This generally does not allow you to imprison an
      incorporeal undead as you normally cannot see all surfaces of a container,
      but it might allow you to ward all surfaces of a room you occupy to keep
      the creature out.
