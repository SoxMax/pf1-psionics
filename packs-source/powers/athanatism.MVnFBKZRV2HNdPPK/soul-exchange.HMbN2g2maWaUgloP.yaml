      <p>You muddle that which affects a soul, switching them between different
      souls. You and the target exchange all soul-based curses, blessings, or
      effects. In addition, you exchange all mental ability damage and drain, as
      well as negative levels. If any of these effects could be reduced or
      removed with a save, their new owner may attempt a new save against each
      such effect. This does not count as if you gained a new version of
      whatever effect you receive – instead, the duration on any of these
      effects continues as normal, just as if nothing had happened. If either
      target is possessed when you manifest this power, the possessing entity
      may succeed on a Will save to choose one of the targets to transfer to -
      otherwise, they remain with the body they were originally possessing.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> By spending an additional 4 power points,
      this power may target an unwilling, living creature touched, unless they
      succeed on a Will save. Power resistance provides protection from this use
      as normal.
