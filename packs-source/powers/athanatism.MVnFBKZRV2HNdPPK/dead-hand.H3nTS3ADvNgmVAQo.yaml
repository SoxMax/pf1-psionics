    value: >-
      <p>You bind a bit of the Ethereal Plane into your hand. You can interact
      with the Ethereal Plane as if one of your hands was also ethereal, but you
      cannot use that hand to manipulate the Material Plane. This means you
      cannot wield a two-handed weapon, and any shield, weapon, or item held in
      the ethereal hand can only affect the Ethereal Plane. If the item you are
      holding has the ghost touch special property, you can hold and wield it as
      normal. Any item dropped from the ethereal hand returns to the Material
      Plane at the end of your turn.

      </p>

      <p>If you grapple a creature while this power is active, you may attempt
      to shunt it partially into the Ethereal Plane. If it fails a Will save, it
      counts as both ethereal and material and is shaken by the horrific sights
      it sees in the spirit realms. This lasts as long as you are grappling it
      or until this power expires, whichever happens first.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> By spending 3 additional power points, you
      may manifest this power on one other hand. This hand may belong to you, or
      to another willing target. If both of your hands are ethereal, you may
      wield items and weapons as normal (albeit ethereally). If you use this
      augmented power on an ethereal creature, they instead gain one material
      hand.
