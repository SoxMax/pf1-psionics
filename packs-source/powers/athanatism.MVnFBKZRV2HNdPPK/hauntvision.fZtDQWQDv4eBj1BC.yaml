      <p>Your body becomes coated in a sheen of frost as your core temperature
      drops, hinting at the spiritual sight you have gained. While under the
      effect of <em>hauntvision</em>, you can detect, identify, and eventually
      understand haunts nearby. The amount of information revealed by the
      manifestation of this power depends on how long you study a particular
      area or subject.

      </p>

      <p>Detection of a haunt may trigger it to manifest, depending on the
      conditions and nature of the individual haunt.

      </p><ul><li><em>1st Round: </em>Presence or absence of
      haunts.</li><li><em>2nd Round: </em>Number of different haunts and the
      strength of the most potent haunt. For purposes of determining a haunt’s
      strength, those with CR 1-3 are considered weak, CR 4-6 moderate, CR 7-9
      strong, CR 10- 12 potent, CR 13-15 imposing, and CR 16+
      deadly.</li><li><em>3rd Round: </em>The strength and location of each
      haunt. If the haunts are within line of sight, you can make Knowledge
      (religion) checks to attempt identification.</li></ul>
