      <p>You see through the eyes of the dead, accessing their last living
      memories. When you manifest this power, you see and hear the last round of
      the creature's life. The base chance for receiving a meaningful result is
      [[70 + 5*@augments.amplify]]%, and shows exactly what the creature saw and
      heard during that time. This includes illusions, darkness, or anything
      else that might alter or obscure perceptions. If the creature was
      unconscious during this time, you see and hear nothing, but you learn that
      it was unconscious. If the power fails, the vision is flawed, changing or
      obscuring the details.</p><p><strong>Augment:</strong> For each additional
      power point you spend, you may see an additional round before the creature
      died. For every power point you spend augmenting this power, increase the
      chance of a meaningful result by 5%, to a maximum of 90%.</p>
