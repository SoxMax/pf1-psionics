    value: >-
      <p>You cause a held object to serve as a bridge between planes. The object
      counts as both ethereal and material, and can be interacted with equally
      by each side. This functions exactly like the ghost touch special item
      property, except that it can be applied to any object that can be
      reasonably held by the manifester.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> You may spend 4 additional power points to
      instead affect part of any object touched, up to 5 square ft./level. This
      can include parts of buildings, ground, or other similar objects.
