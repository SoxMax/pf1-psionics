      <p>You descend into the vaults of night, returning hours later with a
      fallen soul. For the duration of this power, you vanish, effectively
      ceasing to exist. The duration of any effect active on you continues as
      normal, and may expire while you are gone. When this power ends, you
      return in the same location you left, bringing with you the spirit of a
      currently dead person you were at least familiar with, who is then
      restored to life at full hit points and with all spells prepared and power
      points regained, just as if they had rested and recovered them naturally.
      This power ends automatically at the next midnight, at which point target
      immediately dies, its spirit returning from whence it came. If the spirit
      died of old age, is unwilling to go with you, or is a construct, outsider,
      or undead creature, this power fails, ending after only 4 hours.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> By spending an additional 6 power points, you
      may attempt to target an unwilling spirit by succeeding on a manifester
      level check against a DC of 10 + the target's Hit Dice + the target's
      Charisma modifier. If you return an unwilling spirit to life in this way,
      they are controlled by you as if through a geth's mind control power
      manifested by you.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> This power may only be manifested at night.
