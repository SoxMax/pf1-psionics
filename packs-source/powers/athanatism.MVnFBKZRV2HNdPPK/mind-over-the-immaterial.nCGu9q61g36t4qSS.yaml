      <p>Your mastery of the immaterial weakens the mind of those once protected
      by it. The target loses any immunity it has to mind-affecting effects,
      spells, and powers. However, it gains a +4 inherent bonus on saves against
      mind-affecting effects not created by you.

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> By spending an additional 4 power points, you
      can manifest this power as a swift action.
