  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The lurching and uncoordinated movements of a nearby monster suddenly
      take a controlled and purposeful smoothness. When you manifest
      <em>corpsewalk</em>, you temporarily gain the ability to inhabit the body
      of a mindless undead creature such as a skeleton or zombie. Your body
      becomes limp and unresponsive while your consciousness is riding in its
      temporary host. You remain aware of events around your body and you may
      return to it by dismissing <em>corpsewalk </em>(a standard action).

      </p>

      <p>While you inhabit an undead husk, it is unable to act in any way. You
      control its body and may use it as you wish, making slam attacks, moving,
      or using whatever equipment you can place its hands upon.

      </p>

      <p>You gain whatever senses your undead host possesses and the body
      retains any defensive or passive abilities (such as Damage Reduction) it
      has which do not require activation. Otherwise, you do not gain control of
      any supernatural, or psi-like abilities the creature has, nor do you gain
      access to any feats it possesses. You are able to use feats and skills you
      know as long as they are appropriate to the body you are occupying.

      </p>

      <p>You may make Disguise or Bluff checks to attempt to disguise yourself
      but a mindless undead typically moves with a gait that is distinctive and
      unnatural, meaning you are likely to be spotted as unusual while in
      motion.

      </p>

      <p>If your undead host body is destroyed while you occupy it,
      <em>corpsewalk </em>immediately ends. During this power, you are merely
      linking to the undead body and your soul remains within your own, so if
      your host body is within a negative energy effect such as channel negative
      energy, the body heals and you suffer no ill effect.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment: </strong>For every additional two power points you
      spend manifesting this power, you gain the ability to manifest one psionic
      power while you are controlling the undead body and the DC for this power
      increases by one.
