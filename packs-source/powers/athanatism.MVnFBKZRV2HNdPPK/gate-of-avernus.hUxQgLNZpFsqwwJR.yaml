      <p>You tear open a hole in the planes, bringing forth a gate to the
      Ethereal Plane.

      </p>

      <p>Creating a gate of Avernus has two effects.

      </p>

      <p>First, it creates an interdimensional connection between your plane of
      existence and the Ethereal Plane, allowing travel between these two planes
      in either direction.

      </p>

      <p>Second, you may call a particular ethereal individual or kind of
      incorporeal being through the gate of Avernus. When you manifest this
      power, you dedicate a part of yourself to maintaining it. Any power points
      that you spent manifesting this power cannot be regained or restored while
      the power exists. In addition, you suffer 1d6 points of Constitution and
      Wisdom drain when you finish manifestation.

      </p>

      <p>The gate of Avernus is a circular hoop or disk from 5 to 20 feet in
      diameter (manifester's choice) oriented in the direction you desire when
      it comes into existence (typically vertical and facing you). It is a
      two-dimensional window looking into the plane you specified when
      manifesting the power, and anyone or anything that fulfills your entry
      terms, if any, that moves through is shunted instantly to the other side.
      However, this travel is not without risk. Those that would cross from the
      Ethereal Plane suffer 1d6 Wisdom drain, while those that would cross into
      the Ethereal Plane suffer 1d6 Constitution drain. Otherwise, this
      functions much like a plane shift.

      </p><ul><li><em>Planar Travel:</em> For this use, you may set entry terms,
      if you wish. If you do so, you may choose either keyed entry, only
      allowing certain people, or only allowing a certain type of people. Once
      you decide on these terms, they cannot be changed.</li></ul>

      <ul><li>In the first case, any one in possession of a key or specific,
      special object, or knowing a certain passphrase may pass. This key or
      phrase must be decided when manifesting this power, and cannot be
      changed.</li></ul>

      <ul><li>In the second case, you may indicate a number of people up to your
      manifester level when you manifest this power. These people, as well as
      yourself, are the only targets that may pass. No disguise, spell, or
      effect can fool this power.</li></ul>

      <ul><li>In the third case, you may indicate a certain characteristic that
      all who would pass must share. This can be as concrete as alignment, hair
      color, or possession of a certain class ability, or as abstract as deity
      worshiped or personal philosophy.</li></ul>

      <ul><li><em>Calling Creatures:</em> The second use of this power is to
      call forth powerful spirits from the Ethereal Plane. By naming a
      particular being or kind of being as you manifest this power (which must
      have the incorporeal subtype or be native to the Ethereal Plane, or this
      power fails, not expending any material components), you cause the gate of
      Avernus to open in the immediate vicinity of the desired creature and pull
      the subject through, willing or unwilling. Deities and unique beings are
      under no compulsion to come through the gate of Avernus, although may
      choose to do so of their own accord. This use of this power creates a gate
      of Avernus that remains open just long enough to transport the called
      creatures. This use of this power has a material cost of 10,000 gp in
      intricate scrimshaw and rare tributes. This cost is in addition to any
      cost that must be paid to the called creatures.</li></ul>

      <p>If you choose to call a kind of creature instead of a known individual,
      you may call either a single creature or several creatures. In either
      case, their total HD cannot exceed twice your manifester level, and they
      must either have the incorporeal subtype or be native to the Ethereal
      Plane. In the case of a single creature, you can control it if its HD does
      not exceed your manifester level. A creature with more HD than your
      manifester level can't be controlled. Deities and unique beings cannot be
      controlled in any event. An uncontrolled being acts as it pleases, making
      the calling of such creatures dangerous. An uncontrolled being may return
      to the Ethereal Plane at any time.

      </p>

      <p>If you choose to exact a longer or more involved form of service from a
      called creature, you must offer some fair trade in return for that
      service. The service exacted must be reasonable with respect to the
      promised favor or reward; see the lesser planar ally spell for appropriate
      rewards. Some creatures may want their payment in "livestock", time spent
      possessing a mortal body, memories, or emotions (negative levels and
      ability drain) rather than in coin. Immediately upon completion of the
      service, the being is transported to your vicinity, and you must then and
      there turn over the promised reward. After this is done, the creature is
      instantly freed to return to its own plane.

      </p>

      <p>Failure to fulfill the promise to the letter results in your being
      subjected to service by the creature or by its liege and master, at the
      very least. At worst, the creature or its kin may attack you.
