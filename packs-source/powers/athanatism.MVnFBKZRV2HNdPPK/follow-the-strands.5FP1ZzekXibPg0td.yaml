      <p>You become attuned to the link between a ghost and its important
      possessions. If you target a ghost with this power, you learn what (if
      any) objects would be considered important to it, as well as their basic
      whereabouts. If you target an object with this power, you learn the name,
      alignment, and general location of a ghost that considers it important (if
      it is connected to a ghost). In the latter case, the ghost receives a Will
      save to negate the use of this power on its object. If it fails the Will
      save, it is not aware that anything has occurred. If the object or ghost
      is located on another plane, you learn which plane it is on in addition to
      its location. If more than one ghost considers the object equally
      important, you gain knowledge on a random one.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> You may spend an additional 4 power points to
      instead gain knowledge on a living person that considers a targeted object
      important. If more than one living person considers the object equally
      important, you gain knowledge on a random one.
