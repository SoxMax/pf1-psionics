      <p>By marking mortal creatures, you gain knowledge of their mortality. You
      are aware of direction or distance to the creatures and any conditions
      affecting them: unharmed, wounded, disabled, staggered, unconscious,
      dying, nauseated, panicked, stunned, poisoned, diseased, confused, or the
      like. You may also allow the soul to linger in the marked creatures for
      the duration of this power. This extends the period of time that spells
      and powers such as raise dead would be effective. Once this power has been
      manifested upon the subjects, the distance between them and the manifester
      does not affect the power as long as they are on the same plane. If a
      subject leaves the plane, or if it dies, the power ceases to function for
      it.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> This power may be augmented in one of the
      following ways.

      </p><ol><li>By spending an additional 2 power points, increase the
      duration of this power to 1 hour/level.</li><li>By spending an additional
      4 power points, increase the duration of this power to 1
      day/level.</li><li>For every 2 additional power points you spend, you
      extend the negative hit point total at which targets die by 1 hit
      point.</li></ol>

      <p>In addition, for every 2 power points you spend augmenting this power,
      targets gain a +1 bonus on saves against death or negative energy effects.
