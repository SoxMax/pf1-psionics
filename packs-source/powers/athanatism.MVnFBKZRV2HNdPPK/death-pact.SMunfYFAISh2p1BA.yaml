    value: >-
      <p>You form a lasting bond with a willing creature, ensuring them eternal
      unlife even if death should claim them. All it costs them is their
      allegiance. When the target dies, they immediately become a ghost,
      applying the ghost template as normal. They only gain corrupting touch as
      a special attack, however. While the subject is affected by this power,
      they are friendly to you, share your motivations and goals, and are likely
      to follow any reasonable suggestions you make. You may not manifest this
      power on yourself.

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> You may augment this power in one of the
      following ways

      </p><ol><li>You may expend your psionic focus to instead have the target
      become a free-willed wraith after they die. This wraith retains its
      initial alignment. This augment may only be used if the target has 7 or
      more Hit Dice.</li><li>You may spend an additional 2 power points and
      expend your psionic focus to instead have the target become a free-willed
      spectre after they die. This spectre retains its initial alignment. This
      augment may only be used if the target has 9 or more Hit Dice.</li><li>You
      may spend an additional 6 power points and expend your psionic focus to
      instead have the target become a free-willed banshee after they die. This
      banshee retains its initial alignment. This augment may only be used if
      the target has 15 or more Hit Dice.</li><li>You may spend an additional 2
      power points and gain a permanent negative level to grant the target one
      additional ghost special attack of your choice.</li></ol>
