      <p>You lock off your pain receptors, becoming like one of the dead. While
      this power is active, you are immune to pain and emotion effects and
      reduce all mental ability damage you would take by two. In addition,
      whenever you are subjected to a morale effect, you may choose whether or
      not it affects you. If you choose to not be affected, you are immune to
      that instance of the particular effect. When this power ends, any such
      effects resume, provided that their duration has not expired in the
      meantime. However, any ability damage reduced by the use of this power
      remains reduced.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> This power may be augmented in one of the
      following ways.

      </p><ol><li>You may spend 4 additional power points to increase the amount
      you reduce mental damage you would take by 1.</li><li>You may spend 4
      additional power points to reduce any physical damage you would take by
      2.</li><li>By spending an additional 6 power points, increase the duration
      of this power to 1 hour/level.</li></ol>
