    value: >-
      <p>You bring back the soul of one that is recently dead, allowing you to
      question them freely or raise them more easily. A soul brought back in
      this way is treated as a shadow, except that they cannot create spawn and
      do not deal ability damage with their attacks. This soul is not obliged to
      stay or serve, and may attempt a Will saving throw to resist being brought
      back. The soul suffers a penalty on saves equal to your Charisma modifier
      against any Athanatism powers or effects that you manifest in the future.
      A soul that succeeds on this saving throw may not be targeted again by
      this power by the same manifester for 24 hours. If the targeted creature
      has been dead for longer than a week, or died due to negative energy or
      soul-draining effects, this power fails. This power does not affect a
      corpse that has been turned into an undead creature. Each corpse can only
      be affected by one instance of this power at a time.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> This power may be augmented in one of the
      following ways.

      </p><ol><li>For every 2 additional power points you spend, the corpse
      targeted by this power may have been dead for one additional
      week.</li><li>By spending an additional 4 power points, increase the
      duration of this power to 1 hour/level.</li><li>By spending an additional
      6 power points, increase the duration of this power to 1
      day/level.</li><li>By spending an additional 10 power points, you
      may</li></ol>

      <p>raise the soul from the dead. The soul must be willing to return. It
      returns to life with two permanent negative levels. If it is 1st level, it
      takes 2 points of Constitution drain instead (if this would reduce its Con
      to 0 or less, it can't be raised). A target that died with spells prepared
      has a 50% chance of losing any given spell upon being raised. A
      spellcasting creature that doesn't prepare spells has a 50% chance of
      losing any given unused spell slot as if it had been used to cast a spell.
      A manifester that died with power points is raised with half its maximum
      power points, round up. A raised creature has a number of hit points equal
      to its current HD. Any normal poison or diseases affecting the target are
      cured when it returns to life, but missing limbs, magical diseases, and
      curses remain unchanged. It retains the penalty to saves against your
      athanatism effects. When you augment this power in this way, you suffer a
      permanent negative level. This power gains the healing subtype.
