    value: >-
      <p>This power wards the mind and soul of the living from the predations of
      the undead. The target is immune to future possession and possession-like
      effects such as magic jar - if the target is already possessed, this power
      does not remove that effect. They also gain a +2 deflection bonus to AC
      and a +2 resistance bonus on saves, but only against attacks made or
      effects created by incorporeal creatures.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> This power may be augmented in one of the
      following ways.

      </p><ol><li>For every additional power point spent, you can target an
      additional creature when you manifest this power.</li><li>For every 2
      additional power points spent, you increase the bonuses granted by this
      power by 1.</li><li>By spending an additional 4 power points, this power
      affects a 10-ft.-radius emanation from the target. Summoned incorporeal
      creatures cannot enter the area of this power.</li></ol>

      <p>In addition, if you spend at least 4 power points augmenting this
      power, increase the duration of this power to 10 minutes/level.
