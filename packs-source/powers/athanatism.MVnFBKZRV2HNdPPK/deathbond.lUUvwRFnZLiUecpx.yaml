      <p>You form a connection with the target's soul, seeing their surroundings
      at the moment of their death. If the target dies while this power is
      active, you immediately know it, and can see the events of the previous
      round in its immediate area, including who and what killed it. This is
      treated as a scrying sensor, so you can still be fooled by disguises,
      invisibility, stealth, or other similar effects. In addition, in the round
      immediately following the target's death, you may manifest any single
      athanatism power that requires a newly dead body or spirit, targeting them
      regardless of distance or line of effect.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> By spending an additional 4 power points, you
      may place a sensor identical to the one created by clairvoyant sense at
      the location where the target died. This sensor lasts for 1 minute/level.
