      <p>You draw on ghostly essences to cause horrific apparent changes to take
      place in the environment, such as people appearing dead or rotting, walls
      peeling or bleeding, and food decaying. This power has different effects
      based on how close creatures are to the affected area. Multiple effects
      stack - for example, if a creature is inside the area, they are also
      affected as if they were within 30 feet, 10 feet, and inside the area. If
      a creature would be affected by more than one if the following effects, it
      makes saves against each effect separately, in order.

      </p><ul><li><em>Within 30 feet:</em> Creatures within 30 feet of the
      affected area must succeed at a Will save or suffer a -2 penalty on saves
      against any of your other mind-affecting powers for as long as they remain
      within 30 feet of the affected area, and one minute thereafter.</li></ul>

      <ul><li><em>Within 10 feet:</em> Creatures within 10 feet of the affected
      area must succeed at a Will save or become shaken for as long as they
      remain within 10 feet of the affected area, and one minute
      thereafter.</li></ul>

      <ul><li><em>Inside:</em> Creatures that are inside the affected area must
      succeed at a Will save or be frightened for as long as they remain within
      the affected area, and 5 rounds thereafter.</li></ul>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> By spending an additional 6 power points, all
      creatures within the area that fail their save also become confused for as
      long as they remain within the affected area.
