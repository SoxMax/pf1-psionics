      <p>You bridge the gap between life and death, counting temporarily as one
      of the undead. You detect as an undead creature (such as with detect
      undead, but not with magic that reveals your true form) and are treated as
      undead for the purposes of channeled energy, cure spells, and inflict
      spells, but not for other effects that specifically target or react
      differently to undead.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> You may spend an additional 2 power points to
      gain a +2 bonus on saves against mind-affecting effects, disease, poison,
      sleep, and stunning.
