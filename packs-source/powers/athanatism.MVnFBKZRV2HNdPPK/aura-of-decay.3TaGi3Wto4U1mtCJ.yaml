      <p>You deeply infuse one object with the power of decay. Creatures in the
      area of this power must succeed on a Will save or suffer a -2 penalty on
      saving throws against ghost special attacks (such as malevolence,
      corrupting gaze, etc.). This penalty increases by one for each hour that
      they remain within the area of this power. Those that succeed on the
      saving throw are immune to this manifestation of this power. In addition,
      non-magical objects also rot away over time when exposed to this power,
      suffering 1d10 points of damage each hour, ignoring hardness.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> This power may be augmented in one of the
      following ways.

      </p><ol><li>. By expending your psionic focus, you and any objects you
      carry or wield are immune to this manifestation.</li><li>You may spend an
      additional 2 power points to cause rapid aging in those affected. Those
      that fail the Will save also suffer 1 point of ability damage to Strength,
      Dexterity, and Constitution for each hour that they remain in the area of
      this power.</li><li>By spending 4 additional power points, you reduce the
      hardness of all non-magical objects in the area by 2. For each hour that
      an object remains in the area of this power, its hardness is reduced by a
      further 2. After two hours have passed, and after every two hours that
      passes thereafter, the hardness of magical objects in the area is reduced
      by 2 as well. These objects receive their own Will save to resist this
      power.</li></ol>
