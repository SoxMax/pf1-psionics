      <p>You and the willing creatures you touch are transported to the Ethereal
      Plane, where you are contained within a impenetrable, transparent, 20 ft.
      radius dome. This dome is a force effect, and no effects or attacks can
      travel through it in either direction (though it can be seen through in
      either direction, and does not hinder sound). You do not have to remain
      touching the targets while the power is active. When this power ends, you
      and the creatures you brought with you are returned to the area you were
      in when this power was manifested.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> You may augment this power in one of the
      following ways.

      </p><ol><li>By spending an additional 4 power points, you may instead
      target yourself and two willing creatures touched/level.</li><li>By
      spending an additional 2 power points, you may send only the willing
      creatures touched, excluding yourself.</li><li>By spending an additional
      10 power points, you may instead send one unwilling creature touched. This
      creature receives no save, but may resist with power resistance as normal.
      When augmented this way, this power has a duration of 10 minutes. A
      creature targeted by this power may take a full-round action to end this
      power by succeeding at a DC 20 Charisma check.</li></ol>
