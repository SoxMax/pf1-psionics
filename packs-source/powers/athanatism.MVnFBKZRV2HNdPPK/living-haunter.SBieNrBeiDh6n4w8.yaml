      <p>You haunt an area by binding your soul to it. When you manifest this
      power, your soul leaves your body – you count as both unconscious and
      helpless, but you are also immune to mind-affecting effects. While this
      power is active, you may spend a standard action each turn to do one of
      the following.

      </p><ul><li><em>Animate:</em> You may animate a Small or smaller object
      within the area as the control object power. If you do not maintain this
      effect as a standard action, this animation ends.</li></ul>

      <ul><li><em>Hallucinations:</em> You create vivid hallucinations, creating
      the visual illusion of an object, creature, or force, as visualized by
      you. You may also create sounds, but not coherent speech. You can move the
      image within the limits of the size of the effect whenever you maintain
      this effect as a standard action. If you do not maintain this effect as a
      standard action, this effect ends.</li></ul>

      <ul><li><em>Movement:</em> You may alter the speed of any single creature
      in the area of this power. If you choose to accelerate them, they gain a
      +1 bonus on attack rolls, a +1 dodge bonus to AC, an increase in all modes
      of movement of 30 feet (to a maximum of twice the subject's normal speed
      using that mode), and an additional attack with a natural or manufactured
      weapon whenever the subject makes a full attack action, using the
      subject's full base attack bonus and other applicable modifiers. This
      effect is not cumulative with similar effects, such as haste or a speed
      weapon. If you choose to decelerate them, they are staggered, may take
      only a single move action or standard action each turn, take a -1 penalty
      on attack rolls, AC, and Reflex saves, and move at half their normal
      speed. If you do not maintain this effect as a standard action, this
      effect ends. A creature targeted by this use may attempt a Will save to
      resist it (power resistance applies).</li></ul>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> You may augment this power in one of the
      following ways.

      </p><ol><li>For every additional power point you spend, you may target one
      additional creature with the movement ability of this power.</li><li>By
      spending an additional 4 power points, you may include full sound, smell,
      and thermal elements with the hallucinations ability of this
      power.</li><li>For every 2 additional power points you spend, you can
      animate one additional Small object with the animate ability of this
      power. You may instead animate fewer, larger objects, as per control
      object.</li><li>By spending an additional 6 power points, increase the
      duration of this power to 1 min./level.</li></ol>

      <p>If you spend at least 6 power points augmenting this power, you may
      sustain any of its effects as a move action, instead of a standard. This
      allows you to maintain more than one effect each turn.

      </p>
