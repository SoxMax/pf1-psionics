        description: Will negates
        type: will
      target:
        value: One incorporeal creature with 6 HD or less
  description:
    value: >-
      <p>By using this power, you attempt to bind an incorporeal creature to an
      object important to it, which must lie within the powers' range. The
      called creature is bound to the object and to your service until it agrees
      to perform one service in return for its freedom.

      </p>

      <p>First, you must locate an object important to that creature. This can
      the breath of a dying man, a bloodied sword, or be an object that holds
      significance to members of its type (a mirror for a mirror shade, for
      example). When calling a specific individual, you would use things like an
      item that it wielded in life, a picture of it, the tears of its widow, or
      its corporeal remains if it is undead. The type of creature must be known
      and stated. If you wish to call a specific individual, you must use that
      individual's proper name in manifesting this power.

      </p>

      <p>The target creature is allowed a Will saving throw. If the saving throw
      succeeds, the creature resists the power. If the saving throw fails, the
      creature is immediately drawn to the object (power resistance does not
      keep it from being called), and is unable to harm or act against you for
      as long as you hold or own the object it is bound to. You can add a
      special diagram (a two-dimensional bounded figure with no gaps along its
      circumference, augmented with various psionic sigils) to make the circle
      more secure. Drawing the diagram by hand takes 10 minutes and requires a
      DC 20 Spellcraft check. You do not know the result of this check. If the
      check fails, the diagram is ineffective. You can take 10 when drawing the
      diagram if you are under no particular time pressure to complete the task.
      This task also takes 10 full minutes. If time is no factor at all, and you
      devote 3 hours and 20 minutes to the task, you can take 20.

      </p>

      <p>A successful diagram allows you to manifest a wrench spell on the
      circle during the round before manifesting any summoning power. The anchor
      holds any called creatures in the circle for 24 hours per manifester
      level. A creature cannot use its power resistance against a circle
      prepared with a diagram, and none of its abilities or attacks can cross
      the diagram. If the creature tries a Charisma check to break free of the
      trap (see below), the DC increases by 5. The creature is immediately
      released if anything disturbs the diagram—even a straw laid across it. The
      creature itself cannot disturb the diagram either directly or indirectly,
      as noted above

      </p>

      <p>The creature can flee from you by successfully pitting its power
      resistance against your manifester level check, by dimensional travel, or
      with a successful Charisma check (DC 15 + 1/2 your manifester level + your
      Charisma modifier). It can try each method once per day. If it breaks
      loose, it can flee or attack you. If the creature is held within a
      successful circle enhanced by wrench (as described above), they may not
      escape by dimensional travel.

      </p>

      <p>If the creature does not break free of this power, you may keep it
      bound for as long as you wish. You can attempt to compel a creature to
      perform a service by describing the service and either offering some sort
      of reward or damaging the object to attempt to coerce it. In either case,
      you can only attempt to issue the creature commands or negotiate for
      services once in a 24-hour period, and impossible demands or unreasonable
      commands are never agreed to.

      </p>

      <p>For the former case, you make a Charisma check opposed by the
      creature's Charisma check. The check is assigned a bonus of +0 to +6 based
      on the nature of the service and the reward. If the creature wins the
      opposed check, it refuses service. This process can be repeated until the
      creature promises to serve, until it breaks free, or until you decide to
      get rid of it by means of some other effect. If you ever roll a natural 1
      on the Charisma check, the creature breaks free of the power's effect and
      can escape or attack you.

      </p>

      <p>In the latter case, you may damage the object a total of five times to
      attempt to compel the creature. After the fifth time, the object breaks,
      and this power ends. When you damage the item (a standard action), the
      creature takes damage equal to half its maximum hit points, round up, and
      is sickened for 1 round/level. Instead of taking damage, the creature may
      follow one command you give it to the best of its ability.

      </p>

      <p>Once the service or command is completed, the creature need only to
      inform you to be instantly sent back whence it came. The creature might
      later seek revenge. If you assign some open-ended task that the creature
      cannot complete through its own actions, the power remains in effect for a
      maximum of 1 day per manifester level, and the creature gains an immediate
      chance to break free (with the same chance to resist as when it was
      called). Note that a clever recipient can subvert some instructions.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For each additional power point that you
      spend, increase the HD of the creature that you can summon by 1. In
      addition, you may expend your psionic focus to target up to three
      creatures of the same kind, as long as their total Hit Dice is no more
      than the total creature HD you are summoning. Each creature gets a saving
      throw, makes an independent attempt to escape, and must be individually
      persuaded to aid you.
