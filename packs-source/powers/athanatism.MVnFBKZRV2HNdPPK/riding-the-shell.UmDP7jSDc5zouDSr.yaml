      <p>You take a ghostlike form, leaping into the body of a nearby creature.
      For the duration of the power, you see and hear everything they do, can
      not be attacked or affected in any way, and can only take purely mental
      actions, but may not regain your psionic focus, manifest powers, or use
      psi-like abilities. The duration of this power may be extended to 1
      hour/level by targeting a willing creature. If you were hidden from the
      target at the time of manifestation, they are not aware of this power or
      that you are currently inhabiting them.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> By spending an additional 2 power points, you
      may expend your psionic focus as a standard action at any time during the
      duration of this power to manifest a single power or use a single psi-like
      ability. You may not apply metapsionic feats to a power manifested this
      way.
