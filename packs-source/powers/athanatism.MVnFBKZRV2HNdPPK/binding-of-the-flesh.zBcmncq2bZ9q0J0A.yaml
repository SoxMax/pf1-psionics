      <p>You bind pieces of the spirit world to the body of the fallen, granting
      it a new (if temporary) lease on life. The subject cannot be a construct,
      an elemental, an outsider, or undead, must have its soul free and willing
      to return, must have been dead no more than 1 round/level, must not have
      been killed by a death effect or turned into an undead creature, and its
      body must be whole. Any normal poison or diseases affecting the target are
      cured when it returns to life, but missing limbs, magical diseases, and
      curses remain unchanged. Your target returns to life with half of their
      full normal hit points, with any powers points or spells it had previously
      expended still expended. The target dies immediately when this power ends.
      When they do so, their bodies rot away to nothing in an instant, leaving
      their gear and possessions behind. They may not be the target of any power
      that expressly requires remains, such as raise dead, binding of the flesh,
      etc.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> By spending an additional 4 power points, the
      duration of this power becomes 1 day/level.
