    value: >-
      <p>You send an object into the Ethereal Plane, making it ethereal. While
      it is ethereal, the object cannot affect or be affected by any force on
      the Material Plane, except those that can normally interact with the
      ethereal (such as through ghost touch). Any creatures inside the object
      must succeed at a Will save, or be transported along with it. Any
      creatures transported this way become fully ethereal, not incorporeal
      until they leave the object - at which time they immediately return to the
      Material Plane. If the object was part of a larger object, or interacted
      with another object in a significant way (such as the support beam or
      keystone for a building, or a single part of a complex weapon), the
      structure of the other objects that interact with the target is unchanged.

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> You may augment this power in one of the
      following ways.

      </p><ol><li>By spending an additional 6 power points, you may shift an
      area instead of an object. You may shift up to 3,000 sq. ft./level with
      this augmented use of this power. Any creatures inside the area to be
      transported gain Will saves as described above.</li><li>By spending an
      additional 4 power points, increase the duration of this power to 1
      hour/level.</li></ol>
