      <p>You link a power to your spiritual essence, causing it to trigger under
      some condition you dictate when manifesting spiritual contingency. The
      spiritual contingency power and the companion power are manifest at the
      same time. The 10-minute manifesting time is the minimum total for both
      manifestations; if the companion power has a manifesting time longer than
      10 minutes, use that instead. The power to be brought into effect by the
      spiritual contingency must be one that affects your person and be of a
      power level no higher than one-third your manifester level (rounded down,
      maximum 6th level).

      </p>

      <p>The conditions needed to bring the power into effect must be clear and
      discernible, although they can be general. In all cases, the spiritual
      contingency immediately brings into effect the companion power, the latter
      being "manifested" instantaneously only when the prescribed circumstances
      occur. If complicated or convoluted conditions are prescribed, the power
      combination (spiritual contingency and the companion power) may fail when
      called on. The companion power may one that affects a dead creature, in
      which case the power combination manifests immediately upon your death.

      </p>

      <p>You can use only one spiritual contingency companion power at a time;
      if a second is manifested, the first one (if still active) is dismissed.
