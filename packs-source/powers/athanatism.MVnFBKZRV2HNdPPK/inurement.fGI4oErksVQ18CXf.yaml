      <p>By binding your soul to a ghostly power source, you ensure your own
      eternal unlife. If you are killed while this power is active, you
      immediately become a ghost. When you do so, you suffer two permanent
      negative levels, just as if you had been hit by an energy-draining
      creature. These negative levels cannot be removed unless the one
      attempting to remove them succeeds on a DC 26 manifester level check. Your
      ghostly form retains your personality, memories, and class levels. For
      selecting ghost special attacks, you count as if your CR were equal to
      half your manifester level. Except as noted above, this functions exactly
      as if you were applying the ghost template to your character.
