      <p>Your form becomes indistinct and blurry as if viewed through a
      heat-haze. While under the effect of this power, you gain the incorporeal
      monster ability. Because this transformation is temporary, it only grants
      you the ability to move through solid objects as an incorporeal creature
      would, though <em>insubstantial </em>can be augmented to offer additional
      benefits.

      </p>

      <p>When this power ends, you are staggered for one round. Additionally, if
      you are partially or completely inside a material object when this power
      ends, you are ejected into the nearest free space, taking 1d6 points of
      damage per 5 feet of material you move through to find a free space.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment</strong>: You may augment this power in one or more of
      the following ways.

      </p><ul><li>By spending an additional two power points, you gain the
      innate sense of direction common to naturally incorporeal creatures, able
      to move at full speed even when you cannot see. This does not grant you
      any additional senses and is therefore mostly useful while passing through
      solid objects.</li><li>By spending an additional two power points, you can
      move silently. Creatures making Perception checks to observe or locate you
      suffer a -5 penalty on those checks.</li><li>By spending an additional
      four power points, your Armor Class is altered as a natural incorporeal
      creature; you lose any natural armor bonus to Armor Class and gain a
      deflection bonus equal to your Charisma modifier. This bonus does not
      stack with other sources. Any armor or shield that does not have the
      <em>ghost touch </em>property ceases applying to your Armor Class while
      you are incorporeal.</li><li>By spending an additional eight power points,
      you gain immunity to non-magical attack forms and take only half damage
      from magic weapons and powers from corporeal sources. Corporeal powers and
      effects that do not cause damage only have a 50% chance of affecting you.
      Force powers and effects, such as from <em>entangling debris</em>, affect
      an incorporeal creature normally.</li></ul>
