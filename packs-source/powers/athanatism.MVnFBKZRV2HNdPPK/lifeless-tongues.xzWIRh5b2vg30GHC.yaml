    value: >-
      <p>Conduits say that the lips of the dead hold many secrets, known only to
      the dying and the passed. You summon helpful spirits into a corpse,
      allowing it to answer your questions. You may ask up to three questions.
      The corpse's knowledge is limited to what it knew during life, including
      the languages it spoke. Answers are brief, cryptic, or repetitive,
      especially if the creature would have opposed you in life.

      </p>

      <p>If the dead creature's alignment was different from yours, the corpse
      gets a Will save to resist the power as if it were alive. If successful,
      the corpse can refuse to answer your questions or attempt to deceive you,
      using Bluff. The soul can only speak about what it knew in life. It cannot
      answer any questions that pertain to events that occurred after its death.

      </p>

      <p>If the corpse has been subject to either speak with dead or lifeless
      tongues within the past week, the new power fails. You can manifest this
      power on a corpse that has been deceased for any amount of time, but the
      body must be mostly intact to be able to respond. A damaged corpse may be
      able to give partial answers or partially correct answers, but it must at
      least have a mouth in order to speak at all. This power does not affect a
      corpse that has been turned into an undead creature.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> This power may be augmented in one of the
      following ways.

      </p><ol><li>For every 2 additional power points spent, you can ask one
      additional question.</li><li>By spending 4 additional power points, you
      may target an incorporeal creature with this power. If the incorporeal
      creature fails its saving throw against this power, it must honestly
      answer your questions to the best of its ability.</li></ol>

      <p>In addition, for every 2 power points spent augmenting this power,
      increase the power's save DC by 1.
