      <p>You tear down the walls between the ethereal and the material,
      juxtaposing the planes. All creatures in the area become corporeal for 24
      hours, losing any and all ethereal or incorporeal special abilities or
      defenses they had (this includes the special ability to become ethereal).
      If the target lacks a corporeal body, it assume a form of ectoplasm of the
      same size and shape, effectively identical to its incorporeal form (except
      that it is corporeal). Any targets that were incorporeal or ethereal when
      you manifested this power are dazed for 1d4 rounds.
