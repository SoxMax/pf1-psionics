      <p>You adopt a ghostlike form. You are treated as incorporeal, but you may
      not make attacks, cast spells, or manifest powers in this state. Instead,
      you gain a single use of the following ability: you can merge your body
      with an adjacent creature that you can see on the Material Plane. While
      you are merged with the creature, its life force is temporarily trapped
      outside its body, unable to act, but visible on the Ethereal Plane. You
      keep your Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, level, class, base attack bonus,
      base save bonuses, alignment, and mental abilities (including psionics).
      The body retains its Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, hit points,
      natural abilities, and automatic abilities. You can't choose to activate
      this body's extraordinary or supernatural abilities. The creature's powers
      and psi-like abilities do not stay with the body. The target can negate
      this possession with a successful Will save. A creature that successfully
      saves cannot be possessed by you again for 24 hours. If this power expires
      or the creature dies while you are possessing it, the possession
      immediately ends, placing you in a square of your choice adjacent to the
      possessed creature.
