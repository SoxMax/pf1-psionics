      <p>Your power threatens to tear the target's body down to the spirit. This
      power instantly deals 150 points of damage. If the target succeeds on its
      save, it instead takes 3d6 + 15 damage. If this damage destroys the
      target, it cannot return or reform, such as through a ghost's rejuvenation
      ability.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> You may augment this power in one of the
      following ways.

      </p><ol><li>For every additional power point spent, power deals an
      additional 10 points of damage on a failed save. For every two points you
      spend augmenting this power, increase the save DC by 1.</li><li>By
      expending your psionic focus, you may target a living creature touched
      with this power.</li></ol>
