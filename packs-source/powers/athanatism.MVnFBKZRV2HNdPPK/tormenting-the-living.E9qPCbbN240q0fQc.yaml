      torturing them. They are constantly harassed by ghostly hallucinations,
      suffering a -2 penalty on Reflex saves and AC against attacks of
      opportunity. During your turn, as a swift action, you may expend your
      psionic focus to empower the spirit, haunting the creature more intensely.
      It is shaken for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier.
