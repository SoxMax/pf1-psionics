    value: >-
      <p>You temporarily link the fates of any two creatures, if both fail their
      saving throws. If either linked creature experiences pain, both feel it.
      When one loses hit points, the other loses the same amount. If one takes
      nonlethal damage, so does the other. If one creature is subjected to an
      effect to which it is immune (such as a type of energy damage), the linked
      creature is not subjected to it either. If one dies, the other must
      immediately succeed on a Fortitude save against this power's save DC or
      gain two negative levels.

      </p>

      <p>No other effects are transferred by the fate link.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every 2 additional power points you
      spend, this power's save DC increases by 1.
