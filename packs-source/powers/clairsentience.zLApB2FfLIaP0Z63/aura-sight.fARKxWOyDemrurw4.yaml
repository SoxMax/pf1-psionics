      <p>You discern auras. Auras are invisible to the naked eye, but to a
      psionic viewer manifesting this power they appear as glowing halos or
      envelopes of colored light that surround all objects. The color of each
      aura reveals information to the psionic character. The amount of
      information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area.

      </p><ul><li><em>1st Round:</em> Presence of good and evil auras in the
      area. You can't pin an aura to a particular object or individual at this
      stage; instead, you see a colored haze suffusing the area. (This power can
      detect lawful and chaotic auras as well, but doing so requires a separate
      manifestation that focuses only on that alignment axis.)</li></ul>

      <ul><li><em>2nd Round:</em> Number of auras (creatures, objects, powers,
      or spells) in the area. You know how many auras are in the area, even
      though each aura doesn't resolve to its actual location quite
      yet.</li></ul>

      <ul><li><em>3rd Round:</em> The owner of each aura is revealed, unless the
      individual is outside your line of sight. If a creature whose aura you
      detect has 5 or more Hit Dice than you do, you are overwhelmed by its
      presence and dazed for 1 round, and the power ends.</li></ul>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every 2 additional power points you
      spend, this power's range increases by 5 feet.
