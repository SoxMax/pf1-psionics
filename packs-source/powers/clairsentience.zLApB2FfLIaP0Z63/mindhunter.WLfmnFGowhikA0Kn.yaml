      <p>When you go to sleep, you psionically split your subconscious mind from
      your body sending it out to search for another person's subconscious. If
      the creature is intelligent and not immune to mind-affecting powers, the
      subconscious mind tracks it down and returns with the information by the
      time you wake up. If you wake before 8 hours have passed, the power fails
      as the subconscious mind is violently forced back into your consciousness
      once again.

      </p>

      <p>When you manifest this power, you gain a general knowledge of where the
      target person resides if they are on the same plane. You are granted a
      general overview of the surroundings and a rough estimate of where they
      are from your current position such as "in a wood 20 miles to the
      northwest".

      </p>

      <p>Note that the power points spent while dreaming do not regenerate
      during this time and thus you awaken with less than your maximum power
      points.

      </p>

      <p>You must be able to form a mental picture of the target, either through
      direct personal knowledge, from a picture or portrait, or from a
      description of the person, in order to use this power.
