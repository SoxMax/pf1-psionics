      <p>You gain historical vision in a given location. Rooms, streets,
      tunnels, and other discrete locations accumulate psychic impressions left
      by powerful emotions experienced in a given area. These impressions offer
      you a picture of the location's past.

      </p>

      <p>The types of events most likely to leave psychic impressions are those
      that elicited strong emotions: battles and betrayals, marriages and
      murders, births and great pain, or any other event where one emotion
      dominates. Everyday occurrences leave no residue for a manifester to
      detect.

      </p>

      <p>The vision of the event is dreamlike and shadowy. You do not gain
      special knowledge of those involved in the vision, though you might be
      able to read large banners or other writing if they are in your language.

      </p>

      <p>Beginning with the most recent significant event at a location and
      working backward in time, you can sense one distinct event for every 10
      minutes you maintain concentration, if any such events exist to be sensed.
      Your sensitivity extends into the past a maximum number of years equal to
      100 x your manifester level.
