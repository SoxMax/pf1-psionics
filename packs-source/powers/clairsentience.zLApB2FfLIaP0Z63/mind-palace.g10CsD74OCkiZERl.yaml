      <p>At the sound of a sharp snap, your eyes glaze over as you internalize
      your thought processes, rummaging amongst the recesses of your mind to
      reach resources normally inaccessible to your conscious self. For a tiny
      moment of time, your personal sense of time’s passage is distorted,
      granting the priceless boon of time to think. When you manifest <em>mind
      palace</em>, you envision a artificial representation of your mind’s
      contents, and you search within that representation for shards of
      knowledge that might be applicable to the problem immediately before you.
      The amount of hidden useful knowledge to be gained is unpredictable. You
      gain a 1d4 bonus to the next attack roll, saving throw, skill check,
      ability check, manifester level check or similar check you make before the
      start of your next turn.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment: </strong>For every additional two power points you
      spend, bonus granted by this power increases by 1d4.
