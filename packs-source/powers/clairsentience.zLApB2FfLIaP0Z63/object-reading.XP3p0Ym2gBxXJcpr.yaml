      <p>You can learn details of an inanimate object's previous owner. Objects
      accumulate psychic impressions left by their previous owners, which can be
      read by use of this power. The amount of information revealed depends on
      how long you study a particular object.

      </p><ul><li><em>1st Minute:</em> Last owner's race.</li></ul>

      <ul><li><em>2nd Minute:</em> Last owner's gender.</li></ul>

      <ul><li><em>3rd Minute:</em> Last owner's age.</li></ul>

      <ul><li><em>4th Minute:</em> Last owner's alignment.</li></ul>

      <ul><li><em>5th Minute:</em> How last owner gained and lost the
      object.</li></ul>

      <ul><li><em>6th+ Minute:</em> Next-to-last owner's race, and so
      on.</li></ul>

      <p>The power always correctly identifies the last owner of the item, and
      the original owner (if you keep the power active long enough).

      </p>

      <p>There is a 90% chance that this power will successfully identify all
      other former owners in sequence, but there is a 10% chance that one former
      owner will be skipped and thus not identified.

      </p>

      <p>This power will not identify casual users as owners. (Anyone who uses
      an object to attack someone or something is not thereafter considered a
      casual user.)

      </p>

      <p>An object without any previous owners reveals no information. You can
      continue to run through a list of previous owners and learn details about
      them as long as the power's duration lasts. If you use this power
      additional times on the same object, the information yielded is the same
      as if you were using the power on the object for the first time.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every additional power point you spend,
      this power's maximum duration increases by 10 minutes.
