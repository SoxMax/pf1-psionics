      <p>You become a paragon of battle—stronger, tougher, faster, and more
      skilled in combat.

      </p>

      <p>You gain a +2 luck bonus on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, Strength
      checks, and Strength-based skill checks. You also gain 1 temporary hit
      point per manifester level. Whenever you make a full-attack action, you
      can make an additional attack at your full base attack bonus, plus any
      appropriate modifiers. This additional attack is not cumulative with
      similar effects, such as physical acceleration or weapons with the speed
      special ability.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> This power may be augmented in one or more of
      the following ways.

      </p><ol><li>For every 3 additional power points spent, the luck bonus
      improves by 1.</li><li>If you spend 4 additional power points, the power's
      duration becomes 10 minutes/level.</li><li>If you spend 2 additional power
      points, this power gains the <a href="/wiki/Network_power" title="Network
      power">Network</a> descriptor. If used in this fashion, the power's saving
      throw becomes Will negates (harmless) and power resistance becomes Yes
      (harmless).</li></ol>
