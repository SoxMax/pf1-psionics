      <p>You gain a sixth sense. Once during the power's duration, you may
      choose to use its effect. This grants you an insight bonus equal to your
      manifester level (maximum +25) on any single attack roll, combat maneuver
      check, opposed ability or skill check, or saving throw. Alternatively, you
      can apply the insight bonus to your AC against a single attack (even if
      flat-footed). Activating the effect doesn't take an action; you can even
      activate it on another character's turn. You must choose to use the cosmic
      awareness before you make the roll it is to modify, or before the attack
      roll if applying the bonus to your AC. Once used, the power ends. You
      can't have more than one cosmic awareness active on you at the same time.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> By spending 2 additional power points, this
      power's duration increases to "1 hour/level or until discharged".
