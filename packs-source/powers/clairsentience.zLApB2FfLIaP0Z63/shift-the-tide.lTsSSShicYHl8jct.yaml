    value: >-
      <p>You see the flow of battle and are able to make a single correction to
      shift the outcome of events. You force one creature in range to reroll a
      single check. This could be an attack roll, saving throw, opposed check,
      skill check, or any other d20 roll. The creature must take the result of
      the second roll. You can choose to use this power after the result of a
      roll has already been determined - such as to force an enemy who has hit
      an ally to reroll, or to allow an ally to reroll a failed saving throw.

      </p>

      <p>If you target an enemy who makes a successful Will save, their action
      is not altered, but they are instead staggered for one round.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every two additional power points spent,
      the power's save DC increases by 1.
