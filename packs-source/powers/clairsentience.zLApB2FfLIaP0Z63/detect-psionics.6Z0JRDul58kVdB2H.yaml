      <p>You detect psionic auras. A psionic aura is given off by any active or
      permanent power, or during the use of any psionic feat. Characters who
      have levels in a psionic class, creatures with the psionic subtype, and
      creatures with the Wild Talent feat possess psionic auras. The amount of
      information revealed by the manifestation of this power depends on how
      long you study a particular area or subject.

      </p><ul><li><em>1st Round:</em> Presence or absence of psionic
      auras.</li></ul>

      <ul><li><em>2nd Round:</em> Number of different psionic auras and the
      strength of the most potent aura.</li></ul>

      <ul><li><em>3rd Round:</em> The strength and location of each aura. If the
      items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make
      Knowledge (psionics) checks to determine the discipline involved in each
      aura. (Make one check per aura; DC 15 + power level, or 15 + one-half
      manifester level for an effect that is not created by a power, such as
      that of a psionic item.) If the aura emanates from a psionic item, you can
      attempt to identify its properties (see Spellcraft).</li></ul>

      <p>Psionically charged locations, multiple disciplines, or strong local
      psionic emanations may confuse or conceal weaker auras.

      </p><ul><li><em>Aura Strength:</em> A psionic aura's strength depends on a
      functioning power's level or an item's manifester level. If an aura falls
      into more than one category, detect psionics indicates the stronger of the
      two. Detection of an overwhelming aura (see the accompanying table) dazes
      you for 1 round and the power ends.</li></ul>

      <ul><li><em>Lingering Aura:</em> A psionic aura lingers after its original
      source dissipates (in the case of a power) or is destroyed (in the case of
      a psionic item). If detect psionics is manifested and directed at such a
      location, the power indicates an aura of dim (even weaker than a faint
      aura). How long the aura lingers at this dim level depends on its original
      strength:</li></ul>

      <table><tr><th>Original Strength

      </th><th>Duration

      </th></tr><tr><td>Faint

      </td><td>1d6 minutes

      </td></tr><tr><td>Moderate

      </td><td>1d6 x 10 minutes

      </td></tr><tr><td>Strong

      </td><td>1d6 hours

      </td></tr><tr><td>Overwhelming

      </td><td>1d6 days

      </td></tr></table>

      <p>Each round, you can turn to detect psionics in a new area. You can tell
      the difference between magical and psionic auras. The power can penetrate
      barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of
      lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> If you spend 2 additional power points, the
      duration changes to 3 rounds/level (D) (no concentration required) and it
      also gives you a +10 enhancement bonus on Spellcraft checks made to
      identify the properties and command words of magic items in your
      possession. This power does not allow you to identify artifacts.

      <p>* For creatures without a manifester level, use the creature's CR or
      hit die, whichever is lower.

      </p><ul><li><em>Librarian Note</em>: In Psionics Unleashed, this power is
      instead a 1st-level power for psions, wilders, and psychic warriors. In
      addition, it also does not have the duration change augment effect (but
      keeps the +10 Spellcraft effect). Otherwise, it is functionally the same
