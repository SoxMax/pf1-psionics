      <p>You can track creatures with an Intelligence score of 3 or greater by
      following the trails of mental energy they leave behind. Pass without
      trace and similar effects provide no protection from this power; however,
      creatures immune to mind-affecting effects leave no perceptible psychic
      tracks, and cannot be followed this way.

      </p>

      <p>Finding psychic tracks or following them for 1 mile requires a DC 20
      Spellcraft check. Every time the tracks become difficult to follow (such
      as when they intersect with other psychic tracks, enter an area of heavy
      traffic such as a market, or backtrack and diverge), you must make another
      check. If you fail a Spellcraft check, you can retry by meditating for 10
      minutes (low traffic) 1 hour (high traffic) .

      </p>

      <p>While tracking, you move at half your normal speed. You may move up to
      your normal speed by taking a -5 penalty on the Spellcraft check, or
      double your speed by taking a -20 penalty on the Spellcraft check.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every additional power point you spend,
      you gain a +2 bonus on your Spellcraft checks to follow psychic tracks.
