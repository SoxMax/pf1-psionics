      <p>As bend reality, but with more far-reaching effects. A reality revision
      can produce any one of the following effects.

      </p><ul><li>Duplicate any psion power of 8th level or lower, provided the
      power is not on a discipline-restricted list that you do not have access
      to.</li><li>Duplicate any psion power of 7th level or lower even if it's a
      power on a discipline-restricted list that you do not have access
      to.</li><li>Duplicate any other power or spell of 6th level or lower, such
      as a psychic warrior power.</li><li>Undo the harmful effects of many other
      powers, such as microcosm, geas/quest, or insanity.</li><li>Create a
      non-psionic item of up to 25,000 gp in value.</li><li>Grant a creature a
      +1 inherent bonus to an ability score. Two to five reality revisions
      manifested in immediate succession can grant a creature a +2 to +5
      inherent bonus to an ability score. Inherent bonuses are instantaneous, so
      they cannot be negated or dispelled. An inherent bonus cannot exceed +5
      for a single ability score. Inherent bonuses to a particular ability score
      do not stack; only the best one applies.</li><li>Remove injuries and
      afflictions. A single reality revision can aid one creature per manifester
      level, and all subjects are cured of the same kind of
      affliction.</li><li>Revive the dead. Reality revision can bring a dead
      creature back to life by duplicating a resurrection spell. This power can
      revive a dead creature whose body has been destroyed, but the task takes
      two manifestations of reality revision, one to recreate the body and
      another to infuse the body with life again. Reality revision cannot
      prevent a character who is brought back to life from suffering a permanent
      negative level or suffering from Constitution drain.</li><li>Transport
      travelers. This power can lift one creature per manifester level from
      anywhere on any plane and place those creatures anywhere else on any plane
      regardless of local conditions. An unwilling target gets a Will save to
      negate the effect, and power resistance (if any) applies.</li><li>Undo
      misfortune. Reality revision can undo a single recent event. Manifesting
      the power forces a reroll of any single roll made within the last round
      (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new
      result. The reroll, however, may be as bad as or worse than the original
      roll. An unwilling target gets a Will save to negate the effect, and power
      resistance (if any) applies.</li></ul>

      <p>You can try to use reality revision to produce more powerful effects
      than these, but doing so is dangerous. The manifestation may pervert your
      intent into a literal but undesirable fulfillment or only a partial
      fulfillment.

      </p>

      <p>Duplicated powers allow saves and power resistance as normal (but save
      DCs are calculated as though the power is 9th level) and the power is
      treated as if manifested with 17 power points, allowing the manifester to
      choose any appropriate augment options. Powers without augment options are
      simply manifested as normal, but with 9th level save DCs.

      </p>

      <p>Manifesting reality revision requires channeling psionic power through
      specially-treated crystals similar to cognizance crystals that cost 25,000
      gp. The crystal is consumed in the manifestation and becomes inert, unable
      to be used again and losing any value. If a power or spell duplicated by
      reality revision has a material component that costs more than 10,000 gp,
      you must provide that component or additional crystals of the same value.
