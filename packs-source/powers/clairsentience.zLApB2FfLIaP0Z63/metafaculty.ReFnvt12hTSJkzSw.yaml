      <p>You elevate your mind to a near-universal consciousness, cogitating
      countless impressions and predictions involving any creature you have seen
      before, whether personally or by means of another power such as remote
      viewing.

      </p>

      <p>This process gives you an uncannily accurate vision of the creature's
      nature, activities, and whereabouts. When you manifest the power, you
      learn the following facts about the creature.

      </p><ul><li>Its name, race, alignment, and character class.</li><li>A
      general estimate of its level or Hit Dice: low (5 HD or lower), medium (6
      to 11 HD), high (12 to 20 HD), very high (21 HD to 40 HD), or deific (41
      HD or higher).</li><li>Its location (including place of residence, town,
      country, world, and plane of existence).</li><li>Significant items
      currently in its possession.</li><li>Any significant activities or actions
      the creature has undertaken in the previous 8 hours, including details
      such as locales traveled through, the names or races of those the creature
      fought, spells or powers it has used, items it acquired, and items it left
      behind (including the location of those items).</li><li>A current mental
      view of the creature, as described in the remote viewing power, which you
      can maintain for up to 1 minute per level.</li></ul>

      <p>Metafaculty can defeat spells, powers, and special abilities such as
      screen or mind blank (or even a wish spell) that normally obscure
      clairsentience powers. You can attempt a manifester level check (DC 6 +
      manifester or caster level of the creator of the obscuring effect, as
      appropriate) to defeat these sorts of otherwise impervious defenses.

      </p>

      <p>Metafaculty is defeated by epic powers, epic spells, and epic special
      abilities that obscure divinations and clairsentience powers.

      </p>

      <p>The amount of information gained from metafaculty is taxing on the
      mind. You suffer 2 points of ability burn to your key ability score when
      you manifest this power.
