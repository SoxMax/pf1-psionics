      <p>You gain a split second insight into the intentions of your foes
      allowing you to predict and counter their attacks and place them in line
      for a single, devastating final strike.

      </p>

      <p>You gain a +4 insight bonus on attack rolls made to disarm or trip (and
      any relevant ability checks to do so) for one round. If you successfully
      disarm or trip an opponent in melee, you may make an immediate attack of
      opportunity against that opponent at your highest attack bonus with a +4
      circumstance bonus to the attack roll. This counts against your allowed
      number of attacks of opportunity for the round.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> You may augment this power in one or more of
      the following ways:

      </p><ol><li>If you spend 5 additional power points, your critical threat
      range is doubled while making attacks of opportunity from this power.
      Unlike most of these effects, this stacks with Improved Critical or the
      keen weapon property (that is, using a keen scimitar that would normally
      threaten on a 1520 – six numbers – with this augment would lead to attacks
      of opportunity that threaten on a 12-20 – nine numbers).</li><li>For every
      2 additional power points you spend, your insight bonus on disarm and trip
      attempts (including the ability checks as necessary) increases by
      1.</li><li>For every 4 additional power points you spend, this power's
      duration increases by one round.</li><li>Each additional power point you
      spend (including those spent on other augments) gives you a +1 insight
      bonus on damage rolls on attacks of opportunity generated by this
      power.</li></ol>
