      <p>You send your mind across space and dimensions, forming it into a
      quasi-real viewpoint from which you can see and hear some creature located
      at any distance from you, even if planar boundaries separate you. If the
      subject succeeds on a Will save, the remote viewing attempt fails, and you
      can't attempt to view that creature again for at least 24 hours. The
      difficulty of the save depends on how well you know the subject and what
      sort of physical connection (if any) you have to that creature.
      Furthermore, if the subject is on another plane, it gets a +5 bonus on its
      Will save.

      <p>If the subject fails its Will save, your mind coalesces a quasi-real
      viewpoint near enough to the subject to see and hear the subject and its
      immediate surroundings (up 30 feet in all directions away from the
      subject).

      </p>

      <p>While the remote viewing lasts, your real body remains unmoving and
      unaware of your actual surroundings. On the other hand, your quasi-real
      viewpoint is treated in some ways as if it were an invisible ectoplasmic
      form of yourself, except as follows. This power is of the Scrying
      subdiscipline, but use the following information in place of the standard
      scrying sensor. As a quasi-real viewpoint, you can speak (though your
      voice is whispery).

      </p>

      <p>You may potentially be sensed by the subject of your viewing (subjects
      who can see or sense invisible or hidden creatures automatically sense
      you; otherwise you make a Stealth check with a +40 bonus to escape
      detection if immobile, or a +20 bonus if moving). You could be attacked
      (although if you become subject to dispel psionics, the remote viewing
      simply ends). If the subject moves, you can attempt to follow it at a
      speed of 20 feet, though if it gets farther than 30 feet from you (or you
      move farther than 30 feet from it), the power ends.

      </p>

      <p>You can attempt to manifest one power through your quasi-real
      viewpoint, but you must make a concentration check (DC 20 + level of the
      power you wish to manifest) to succeed. Manifesting (or attempting and
      failing to manifest) a power immediately ends the remote viewing.

      </p>

      <p>Furthermore, all powers from your quasi-real viewpoint cost twice the
      usual number of power points (you can't exceed the power point limit set
      by your manifester level, so you are restricted to manifesting lower-level
      powers than you otherwise could). Power points you spend as a quasireal
      viewpoint are drained from your real body.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> By spending 2 additional power points, the
      quasi-real viewpoint can move at a speed of 40 feet.
