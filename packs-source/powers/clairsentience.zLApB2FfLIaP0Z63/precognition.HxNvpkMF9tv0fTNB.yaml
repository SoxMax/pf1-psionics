      <p>Precognition allows your mind to glimpse fragments of potential future
      events—what you see will probably happen if no one takes action to change
      it. However, your vision is incomplete, and it makes no real sense until
      the actual events you glimpsed begin to unfold. That's when everything
      begins to come together, and you can act, if you act swiftly, on the
      information you previously received when you manifested this power.

      </p>

      <p>In practice, manifesting this power grants you a "precognitive edge."
      Normally, you can have only a single precognitive edge at one time. You
      must use your edge within a period of no more than 10 minutes per level,
      at which time your preknowledge fades and you lose your edge.

      </p>

      <p>You can use your precognitive edge in a variety of ways. Essentially,
      the edge translates into a +2 insight bonus that you can apply at any time
      to either an attack roll, a damage roll, a saving throw, or a skill check.
      You can elect to apply the bonus to the roll after you determine that your
      unmodified roll is lower than desired.
