      <p>You generally know where you are. This power is useful to characters
      that end up at unfamiliar destinations after teleporting, using a gate, or
      traveling to or from other planes of existence. The power reveals general
      information about your location as a feeling or presentiment. The
      information is usually no more detailed than a summary that locates you
      according to a prominent local or regional site. Using this power also
      tells you what direction you are facing.

      </p>

      <p>Using this power prior to making a Knowledge (planes) check with astral
      caravan grants a +2 bonus on the check.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> If you expend your psionic focus when
      manifesting this power, the cost of the power is reduced by 1 (to a
      minimum of 0).
