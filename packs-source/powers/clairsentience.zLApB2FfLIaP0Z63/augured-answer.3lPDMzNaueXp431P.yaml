      <p>You can predict a useful piece of advice in reply to a question
      concerning a specific goal, event, or activity that is to occur within 1
      week. The advice augured can be as simple as a short phrase, or it might
      take the form of a cryptic rhyme or omen. If your party doesn't act on the
      information, the conditions may change so that the information is no
      longer useful. The base chance for a correct answer is 70% + 1% per
      manifester level, to a maximum of 90%. If the die roll fails, you know the
      attempt failed, unless specific effects yielding false information are at
      work.

      </p>

      <p>Multiple attempts about the same topic by the same manifester use the
      same dice result as the first attempt and yield the same answer each time.
