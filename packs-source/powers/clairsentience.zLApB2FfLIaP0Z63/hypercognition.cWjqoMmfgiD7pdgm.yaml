      <p>You make lightning-fast deductions based on only the slightest clue,
      pattern, or scrap of memory resident in your mind. You can make reasonable
      statements about a person, place, or object, seemingly from very little
      knowledge. However, your knowledge is in fact the result of a rigorously
      logical process that you force your mind to undertake, digging up and
      correlating every possible piece of knowledge bearing on the topic
      (possibly even extracting echoes of knowledge from the Astral Plane).

      </p>

      <p>The nature of the knowledge you gain concerning the subject of your
      analysis might include the answer to a riddle, the way out of a maze,
      stray bits of information about a person, legends about a place or an
      object, or even a conclusion concerning a dilemma that your conscious mind
      is unable to arrive at.

      </p>

      <p>An Intelligence check may be required to obtain the desired
      information. If so, you can manifest hypercognition as an immediate action
      prior to making the check and receive a +20 bonus for doing so.
