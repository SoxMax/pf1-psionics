      <p>You weave your prophetic power into song, using it to bolster your
      allies with visions of the future. Allies within the area gain a +1
      insight bonus to their attack rolls as long as you concentrate on singing,
      humming, or otherwise making music (allies within the area of silence or
      similar effects, or who are deafened, cannot benefit from this bonus). You
      cannot manifest this power while unable to make music, such as by being
      within the area of a silence spell.

      </p>

      ways.

      applies to skill checks.</li><li>If you spend 8 additional power points,
      the insight bonus also applies to weapon damage rolls in addition to the
      above options.</li><li>If you spend 12 additional power points, the
      insight bonus also applies to AC in addition to the above
      options.</li><li>If you spend 16 additional power points, the insight
      bonus also applies to saving throws in addition to the above
      options.</li></ol>

      every 2 power points spent on the above options.

      while manifesting this power, change its duration to 'concentration plus 3
