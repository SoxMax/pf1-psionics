      <p>Your shield of insight alerts you to potential dangers and supercharges
      your reaction time. You gain a +1 insight bonus on your Initiative checks
      for the duration of the effect. As an immediate action, even if you are
      caught flatfooted (an exception to the rule that you cannot normally take
      immediate actions while flat-footed), you may add this bonus to a single
      Reflex save as a resistance bonus; doing so ends the
      effect.</p><p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every 5 additional power
      points you spend, the insight bonus increases by +1.</p>
