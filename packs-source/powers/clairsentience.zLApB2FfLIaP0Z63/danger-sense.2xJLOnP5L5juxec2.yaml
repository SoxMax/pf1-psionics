      <p>You can sense the presence of danger before your senses would normally
      allow it. Your intuitive sense alerts you to danger from traps, giving you
      a +4 insight bonus on Reflex saves to avoid traps and a +4 insight bonus
      to Armor Class against attacks by traps.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> If you spend 3 additional power points, this
      power also gives you the uncanny dodge ability; if you spend 6 additional
      power points, this power gives you the improved uncanny dodge ability as
      well.
