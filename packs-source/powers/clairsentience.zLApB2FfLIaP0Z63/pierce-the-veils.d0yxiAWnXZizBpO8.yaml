      <p>You gain the ability to see all things as they actually are. You see
      through normal and psionic darkness, notice secret doors hidden by
      psionics, see the exact locations of creatures or objects under blur or
      displacement effects, see invisible creatures or objects normally, see
      through illusions, and see the true form of polymorphed, changed, or
      transmuted things. Further, you can focus your vision as a standard action
      to instead see into the Ethereal Plane (but not into extradimensional
      spaces). The visual range of the effect conferred is 120 feet.

      </p>

      <p>This does not, however, penetrate solid objects. It in no way confers
      X-ray vision or its equivalent. It does not negate concealment, including
      that caused by fog and the like. This effect does not help you see through
      mundane disguises, spot creatures that are simply hiding, or notice secret
      doors hidden by mundane means. In addition, the effects cannot be further
      enhanced with known magic, so one cannot use this power through a crystal
      ball or in conjunction with effects such as clairaudience/clairvoyance.
