    value: >-
      <p>You show the targeted creature a vision of the future that is slightly
      incorrect. At any point in the target's turn, you can reposition them 5
      ft. to reflect their reaction to the false insight. The target may react
      after the reposition has occurred. This might make an action the creature
      was about to take invalid, such as repositioning them when they are about
      to make an attack, in which case the action is wasted.

      </p>

      <p>You cannot reposition the creature into a square which they could not
      occupy or where there is no ground (such as over a cliff, into a river, or
      a flow of lava). Repositions using this power do not provoke attacks of
      opportunity.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every 2 additional power points spent,
      this power lasts an additional round and the save DC increases by 1. The
      target gets a save on every round this effect is used upon them at the
      same save DC.
