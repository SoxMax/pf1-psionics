      <p>You create a temporary dreamstate in the mind of a sleeping creature,
      sheltering it from outside influence while providing it with a pristine
      resting environment, ideal for recovering mental energies. For the
      duration of this power, the subject is immune to all mind-affecting
      effects and may make saving throws normally (it is not automatically
      considered "willing" as unconscious creatures usually are).

      </p>

      <p>After a guarded sleep of at least 8 hours, a subject's mind is in top
      condition, and it gains special benefits based upon its particular
      abilities. If the target could manifest psionic powers, it gains one
      temporary power point for each manifester level it has (which it can
      access as if from a cognizance crystal). If the target could cast arcane
      spells spontaneously, it gains one additional spell slot of his highest
      level. If the target prepares arcane spells, it may prepare spells in half
      the usual amount of time. These benefits fade when the target next sleeps.
      You cannot manifest guarded sleep on yourself unless you are capable of
      manifesting powers while unconscious.
