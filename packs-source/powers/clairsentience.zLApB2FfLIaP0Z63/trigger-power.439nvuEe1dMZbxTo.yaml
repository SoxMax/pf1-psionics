      <p>You can place another power upon your person so that it comes into
      effect under some condition you dictate when manifesting trigger power.
      The trigger power power and the companion power are manifest at the same
      time. The 10-minute manifesting time is the minimum total for both
      manifestations; if the companion power has a manifesting time longer than
      10 minutes, use that instead. The power to be brought into effect by the
      trigger power must be one that affects your person and be of a power level
      no higher than one-third your manifester level (rounded down, maximum 6th
      level).

      </p>

      <p>The conditions needed to bring the power into effect must be clear and
      discernable, although they can be general. In all cases, the trigger power
      immediately brings into effect the companion power, the latter being
      "manifested" instantaneously only when the prescribed circumstances occur.
      If complicated or convoluted conditions are prescribed, the power
      combination (trigger power and the companion power) may fail when called
      on.

      </p>

      <p>You can use only one trigger power companion power at a time; if a
      second is manifested, the first one (if still active) is dismissed.
