      <p>Your ability to form and implement a plan rapidly is improved. When you
      manifest this power, you can use the Readying An Action special initiative
      action without specifying the conditions that will trigger your readied
      action. You must still specify what action you will take as your readied
      action.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment: </strong>If you spend six additional power points, the
      duration increases to 1 round per level, but once you take the readied
      action, the power ends.
