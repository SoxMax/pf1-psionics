      <p>You take a hand in influencing the probable outcomes of your immediate
      environment. You see the many alternative branches that reality could take
      in the next few seconds, and with this foreknowledge you gain the ability
      to reroll one attack roll, one saving throw, one ability check, or one
      skill check. You must take the result of the reroll, even if it's worse
      than the original roll. You do not have to make another roll if satisfied
      with your original roll.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every 3 additional power points spend,
      you gain a +1 insight bonus on the reroll.
