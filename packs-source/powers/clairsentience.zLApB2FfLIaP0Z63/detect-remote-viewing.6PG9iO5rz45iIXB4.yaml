      <p>You immediately become aware of any attempt to observe you by means of
      a scrying power or spell. The power's effect radiates from you and moves
      as you move. You know the location of every psionic or magical sensor
      within the power's area.

      </p>

      <p>If the viewing attempt originates within the area, you also know the
      viewer's location. Otherwise, you and the remote viewer immediately make
      opposed manifester level checks (1d20 + manifester level, or viewer's
      caster level as appropriate). If you at least match the remote viewer's
      result, you get a visual image of the remote viewer and an accurate sense
      of the remote viewer's direction and distance from you.
