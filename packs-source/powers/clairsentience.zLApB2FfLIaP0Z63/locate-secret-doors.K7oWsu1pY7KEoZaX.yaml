      <p>You can detect secret doors, compartments, caches, and so forth. Only
      passages, doors, or openings that have been specifically constructed to
      escape detection are detected by this power. The amount of information
      revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject.

      </p><ul><li><em>1st Round:</em> Presence or absence of secret
      doors.</li></ul>

      <ul><li><em>2nd Round:</em> Number of secret doors and the location of
      each. If an aura is outside your line of sight, then you discern its
      direction but not its exact location.</li></ul>

      <ul><li><em>Each Additional Round:</em> The mechanism or trigger for one
      particular secret portal closely examined by you. Each round, you can turn
      to locate secret doors in a new area.</li></ul>

      <p>The power can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common
      metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.
