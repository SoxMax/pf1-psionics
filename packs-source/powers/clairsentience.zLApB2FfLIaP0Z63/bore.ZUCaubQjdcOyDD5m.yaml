  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The seemingly impenetrable solid surface before you frosts over with a
      sheet of ice crystals which upon deeper inspection can be seen to hold
      images of another place. You can manifest this power on a wall, door, or
      similar surface, creating a virtual pinhole through to the other side.
      This hole is up to one inch in diameter and is only visible from your side
      of the surface. You can see through this hole but not hear through it, nor
      can you pass items through the crystals.

      </p>

      <p>This power does not provide illumination to the other side, but
      alternate means of vision such as darkvision function as expected. Also,
      the vision of the other side is tuned to your psyche, providing only a
      scrambled blur of color to anyone other than you who attempts to see
      through.

      </p>

      <p><em>Bore </em>is blocked by stone thicker than 1 foot, common metal
      thicker than one inch, a thin sheet of lead, or by wood or dirt thicker
      than 3 feet.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment: </strong>For each additional five power points you
      spend, the thickness of the materials <em>bore </em>can penetrate are
      doubled.
