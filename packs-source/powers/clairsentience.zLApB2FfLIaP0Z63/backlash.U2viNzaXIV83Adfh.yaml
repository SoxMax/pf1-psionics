      <p>You gain a flash of foresight, allowing you to strike back at an enemy.
      As part of manifesting this power, you can make a full-attack action
      against a creature that has damaged you, so long as the creature is within
      range. However, this foresight overloads your senses after your attack,
      and until the end of your next turn, you are dazed. This dazed effect
      cannot be removed by any means except its normal expiration at the end of
      your next turn. You can only use this power immediately in response to
      being damaged by a creature and must target the creature that caused the
      damage.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> By spending an additional 8 power points, you
      are not dazed after making your attack.
