      <p>You know where you are in relation to a fixed starting point, which is
      essential for setting up a mishap-free teleport beacon. While the duration
      lasts, you are aware of your exact distance and route (physical or
      psychoportive) back to a fixed starting point. The "anchored" starting
      point is your exact location when you manifest the power. To designate
      other anchored starting points, you must manifest this power multiple
      times and be present at the desired locations when you do so.

      </p>

      <p>You can also retrace your steps through a maze automatically while the
      power lasts, without resorting to a map.

      </p>

      <p>Anchored navigation grants you a mindlink with one designated creature
      who remains within a 60-foot radius of the starting point, regardless of
      the distance between you and the creature. The use of anchored navigation
      is confined to the plane of existence where you manifest it.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> If you spend 6 additional power points, the
      effect of this power extends across all planar boundaries.
