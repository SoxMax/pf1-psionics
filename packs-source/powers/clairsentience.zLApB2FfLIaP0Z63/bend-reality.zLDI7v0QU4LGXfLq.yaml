      <p>Bend reality lets you create nearly any type of effect. For example,
      bend reality can do any of the following:

      </p><ul><li>Duplicate any psion/wilder power of 6th level or lower,
      provided the power is on the psion/wilder power list or your discipline
      power list (if any).</li><li>Duplicate any other power (but not a spell)
      of 5th level or lower, provided the power is not of a discipline
      prohibited to you.</li><li>Duplicate any psion/wilder power of 5th on a
      discipline power list.</li><li>Duplicate any other power (but not a spell)
      of 4th level or lower, even if it's of a prohibited
      discipline.</li><li>Undo the harmful effects of many powers, such as mind
      control, geas/quest, or insanity.</li><li>Produce any other effect whose
      power level is in line with the above effects, such as a single creature
      automatically hitting on its next attack or taking a –7 penalty on its
      next saving throw.</li></ul>

      <p>A duplicated power allows saving throws and power resistance as normal
      (but the save DC is for a 7th-level power).

      </p>

      <p>Manifesting bend reality requires channeling psionic power through
      specially-treated crystals similar to <em><a
      href="/wiki/Cognizance_Crystals" title="Cognizance Crystals">cognizance
      crystals</a></em> that cost 1,500 gp. The psionic energy in the crystal is
      consumed in the manifestation and the crystal becomes inert and has no
      value.
