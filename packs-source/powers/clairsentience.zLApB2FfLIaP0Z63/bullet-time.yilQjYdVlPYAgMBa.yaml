      <p>With a sudden blur of activity, you fling yourself out of the path of a
      deadly oncoming projectile. You are able to manifest this power in
      reaction to a perceived ranged attack, including ranged touch attacks such
      as rays. You must decide to manifest <em>bullet time </em>before an attack
      roll is made.

      </p>

      <p>When using <em>bullet time</em>, you may attempt a single Reflex save
      to evade the incoming attack. The DC for this save is equal to the attack,
      minus 10. If you succeed at this Reflex save, the incoming ranged attack
      automatically misses. If you fail the save, the attack is resolved
      normally (which may possibly still miss).

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment: </strong>For every additional two power points you
      spend, you make attempt to evade one additional ranged attack made by the
      same source whose turn you interrupt with your immediate action. You do
      not need to determine how many power points to spend at the moment of
      manifestation; the power lingers for the attacker’s turn, allowing you to
      spend additional power points during that time.
