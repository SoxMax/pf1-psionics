      <p>When you manifest this power, when you would normally be hit with an
      attack from a ranged weapon, you may deflect it so that you take no damage
      from it. Unusually massive ranged weapons (such as boulders or ballista
      bolts) and ranged attacks generated by natural attacks or spell effects
      can't be deflected.
