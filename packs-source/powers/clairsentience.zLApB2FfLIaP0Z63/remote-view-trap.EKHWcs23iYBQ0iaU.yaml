      <p>When others use clairvoyant sense, remote viewing, or other means of
      scrying you from afar, your prepared trap gives them a nasty surprise. If
      the scryer fails its saving throw, you are undetected. Moreover, the
      would-be observer takes 8d6 points of electricity damage. If the scryer
      makes its saving throw, it takes only 4d6 points of electricity damage and
      is able to observe you normally. Either way, you are aware of the attempt
      to view you, but not of the viewer or the viewer's location. It is
      possible that you might recognize the quasi-real viewpoint of someone
      using the remote viewing power if you could pierce its invisibility (which
      is true for remote viewing whether or not you use this power).
