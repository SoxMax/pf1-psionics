    value: >-
      <p>When manifested, this power prevents clairsentience or divination
      effects from detecting or locating the target and also renders the
      affected target invisible (as the invisibility spell). The power does not
      prevent the subject from being discovered through tactile means or through
      the use of devices. Creatures affected by ensconce become comatose and are
      effectively in a state of suspended animation until the effect ends.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Note:</strong> The Will save prevents an attended or magical
      object from being ensconced. There is no save to see the ensconced
      creature or object or to detect it with a clairsentience power or
      divination spell, such an attempt automatically fails.
