      <p>You have metaphoric "eyes in the back of your head," and on the sides
      and top as well, granting you benefits in specific situations. In effect,
      you have a 360-degree sphere of sight, allowing you a perfect view of
      creatures that might otherwise flank you. Thus, flanking opponents gain no
      bonus on their attack rolls, and rogues are denied their sneak attack
      ability while flanking you (but they may still sneak attack you if you are
      caught flat-footed). Your visionbased Perception checks gain a +4
      enhancement bonus.

      </p>

      <p>Concurrently, you take a –4 penalty on saves against all gaze attacks
      during the power's duration.
