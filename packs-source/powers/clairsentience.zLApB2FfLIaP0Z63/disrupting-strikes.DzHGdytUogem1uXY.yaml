      <p>You can use your disrupt pattern ability as part of a full attack
      sequence instead of as a standard action. Any or all of the attacks in the
      full attack sequence can be your disrupt pattern ability in place of a
      normal attack. This is an exception to the rule that disrupt pattern may
      only be used once a round.
