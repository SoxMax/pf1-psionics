    value: >-
      <p>You plant a powerful aversion in the mind of the subject. If the object
      of the implanted aversion is an individual or a physical object, she will
      prefer not to approach within 30 feet of it. If it is a word, she will try
      not to utter it; if it is an action, she will not willingly attempt to
      perform it; and if it is an event, she will not willingly attend it. The
      subject will take reasonable steps to avoid the object of its aversion,
      but will not put herself in jeopardy by doing so.

      </p>

      <p>If the subject is forced into taking an action she has an aversion to,
      she takes a –2 penalty on any attack rolls, ability checks, or skill
      checks involved.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every 2 additional power points you
      spend, this power's save DC increases by 1 and the duration increases by 1
      hour.
