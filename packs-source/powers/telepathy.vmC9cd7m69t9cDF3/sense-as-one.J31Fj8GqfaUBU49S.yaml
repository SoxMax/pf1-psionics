      <p>When you manifest this power, choose one of the following sensory
      special abilities that you or a willing target possesses: blindsense,
      darkvision, low-light vision, scent, tremorsense. You and the target are
      both treated as having the special ability for the duration of the effect.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> You can augment this power in one or more of
      the following ways.

      </p><ol><li>If you spend 2 additional power points, you may also choose
      blindsight as a special ability to share.</li><li>If you spend 2
      additional power points, this power can affect an unwilling target, and
      the power's saving throw becomes "Will negates." Unwilling targets do not
      gain the benefit of the shared sense, and you may cause that target to be
      treated as if it did not have the sensory special ability.</li></ol>

      <p>In addition, for every 2 power points spent augmenting this power, the
      save DC increases by 1.
