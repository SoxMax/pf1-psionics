    value: >-
      <p>This power links the fighting prowess of one to another. Treat all
      targets of this power in all ways as if they have a base attack bonus
      equal to the highest base attack bonus amongst all willing targets
      affected (this can grant additional attacks per round as usual for a high
      base attack bonus).

      </p>

      <p>Temporary effects that alter base attack bonus are ignored by this
      power. While subjects still gain the benefit of both effects, prowess as
      one only deals with their regular base attack bonus before other temporary
      effects are applied.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> You may augment this power in one or both of
      the following ways.

      </p><ol><li>For every 3 additional power points you spend, you can share
      one of the target's weapon proficiencies with every other willing
      target.</li><li>If you spend 4 additional power points, you can instead
      share the lowest base attack amongst any targets you choose instead of the
      highest. This can cause a loss of melee attacks or deny use of feats or
      class abilities. If a recipient's base attack bonus would be lowered
      through the use of this power, they may attempt a Will saving throw each
      round to ignore its effects.</li><li>For every 4 additional power points
      you spend, you may also select one class feature belonging to you or a
      target that directly modifies the base attack bonus you share, either by
      providing a bonus or by altering the base attack bonus. Example class
      features include the monk's Flurry of Blows class feature. The GM may
      allow additional abilities at his discretion. You may effectively grant
      this class feature to any or all willing targets of your choice; treat
      them as if they actually had the class feature in question, with one
      exception: if a class feature has additional benefits besides directly
      modifying the base attack bonus, those additional benefits are not
      included.</li></ol>
