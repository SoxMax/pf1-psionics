    value: >-
      <p>You store a single power in your mind as a trap to any who would
      trespass there. When you manifest this power, select another power you
      know with a range of close or greater, and a target of 'one creature'.
      That power is stored inside your mind trap (you may still manifest it
      normally).

      </p>

      <p>When you succeed at a saving throw against a mind-affecting power,
      spell, or ability, you may trigger the stored power, targeting the source
      of the effect you saved against (regardless of the distance between you
      and that source). You must pay all costs associated with the power, and
      may augment it as normal.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every 4 additional power points you
      spend, you may trigger the power stored in your mind trap an additional
      time. You still need to pay all costs associated with the triggered power
      each time you use it.
