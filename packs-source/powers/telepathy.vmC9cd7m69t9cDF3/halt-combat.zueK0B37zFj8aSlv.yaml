      <p>You send out a powerful telepathic command, dazing all creatures in the
      area for one round unless they make a successful Will save. During this
      round, time continues for all creatures in the area as normal.

      </p>

      <p>As part of the action of manifesting this power, you may attempt to
      convince some or all of the affected creatures to cease combat once the
      initial effect wears off. Each creature you target to cease combat must
      make a second Will save or they are incapable of taking an offensive
      action for the next ten minutes except against a creature who takes an
      offensive action against them.
