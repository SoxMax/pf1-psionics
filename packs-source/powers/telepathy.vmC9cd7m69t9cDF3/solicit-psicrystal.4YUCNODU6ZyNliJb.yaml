      <p>Your <a href="/wiki/Psicrystal" title="Psicrystal">psicrystal</a> takes
      over the responsibility of maintaining concentration on any single power
      you have manifested and are concentrating on. While maintaining this
      concentration, the psicrystal is limited to move actions in each round, as
      normal, unless the maintaining concentration on the power would not allow
      a move action. When the duration of solicit psicrystal expires, the power
      you transferred to the psicrystal ends (even if this would mean that the
      power ends earlier than normal). If necessary, the psicrystal makes
      concentration checks using your modifier.

      </p>

      <p>You can manifest this power (and transfer the responsibility) with an
      instant thought, quickly enough to gain the benefit of the power before
      you take any other actions in a round.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every additional power point you spend,
      this power's maximum duration increases by 1 round.
