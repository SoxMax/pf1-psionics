      <p>You reach into the minds of your targets and cloud them, making them
      think they are deep inside an overwhelming mist or fog. Those who fail
      their Will saves are affected as follows: The mental mist obscures all
      sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet has
      concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have
      total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker can't use sight to
      locate the target).

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> This power can be augmented in one or more of
      the following ways.

      </p><ol><li>If you spend 4 additional power points, all targets that fail
      their saves are mentally drained, move at half their normal speed and take
      a -2 penalty on all attack rolls and melee damage rolls and cannot take a
      5-foot-step while inside.</li><li>If you spend 4 additional power points,
      all targets that failed their Will save also take 1d6 points of damage at
      the start of your turn, beginning with the turn you manifest the mental
      mist.</li><li>If you spend 6 additional power points, all targets must
      make a Fortitude save at the beginning of their turn or be overwhelmed by
      horrid mental images tearing them apart, taking 1d4 points of Wisdom
      damage. If they succeed on this save, they take half damage.</li><li>If
      you expend your psionic focus, you can exclude yourself from all effects
      while inside the area.</li></ol>
