      <p>You take over control of a power that was manifested by the subject and
      that must be maintained through concentration. Once you wrest control of
      the power from the subject, you have several options.

      </p><ul><li>Allow the power to function as normal.</li><li>Keep the power
      targeted on the subject (if a personal power) but decide how the power
      fulfills its function each round.</li><li>Retarget the power on yourself
      (if a personal power).</li><li>Choose not to concentrate on the co-opted
      power in the next round, ending the power at that point.</li></ul>

      <p>When the duration of co-opt concentration expires, the power you took
      control of ends (even if this would mean that the power ends earlier than
      normal).
