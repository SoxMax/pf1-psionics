      <p>You overload the target creature's mental and physical faculties with
      fear, a fear so powerful that even creatures near the original target are
      affected by the residual energy. When you manifest this power, the target
      is cowering unless it makes a successful Will save.

      </p>

      <p>In addition, all enemies within 20 feet of the target, including the
      target, are shaken for 1 round.

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> You can augment this power in one or more of
      the following ways.

      </p><ol><li>For every 2 additional power points you spend, the duration of
      the shaken condition increases by 1 round.</li><li>For every 4 additional
      power points you spend, the radius for nearby affected creatures increases
      by 10 feet. In addition, for every 2 power points you spend augmenting
      this power, the save DC increases by +1.</li></ol>
