      <p>While the duration of this power lasts, you become aware of the
      presence of any creatures with hostile intent within 30 feet of you, and
      their direction from you (but not their specific location). The power
      detects active aggression, as opposed to vigilance. In addition, while
      this power is active you cannot be surprised or caught flatfooted by
      creatures that are susceptible to mind-affecting powers.

      </p>

      <p>While under the effect of this power, you can make Sense Motive checks
      as a free action against anyone within 30 feet of you.

      </p>

      <p>The power can penetrate barriers, but 3 feet of stone, 3 inches of
      common metal, 1 inch of lead, or 6 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.
