    value: >-
      <p>You make yourself completely undetectable to the subject by erasing all
      awareness of your presence from its mind. This power has the following
      effects.

      </p>

      <p>First, you are invisible and inaudible to the creature. It cannot even
      detect your presence by means of blindsense, blindsight, scent, or
      tremorsense. It cannot pinpoint your location by any means.

      </p>

      <p>Second, the subject remains unaware of your actions, provided you do
      not make any attacks or cause any obvious or directly threatening changes
      in the subject's environment.

      </p>

      <p>If you attack the subject creature, the effect ends. If you take an
      action that creates a sustained and obvious change in the subject's
      environment—for example, attacking a creature aside from the subject or
      moving a large or attended object the subject can see—the subject
      immediately gains a new saving throw against the power. An ally of the
      subject creature that is able to see or perceive you can use a move action
      to warn the subject and thereby grant it a new saving throw.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> This power may be augmented in one or both of
      the following ways.

      </p><ol><li>If you spend 6 additional power points, you may manifest this
      power as an immediate action.</li><li>For every 2 additional power points
      you spend, this power can affect one additional creature.</li><li>If you
      spend 8 additional power points, this power effects one creature per
      manifester level.</li></ol>

      <p>In addition, for every 2 power points spent on any of the above
      options, the power's save DC increases by 1.
