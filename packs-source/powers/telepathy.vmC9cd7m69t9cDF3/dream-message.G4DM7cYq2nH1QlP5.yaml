    value: >-
      <p>You, or a messenger you touch, send a message to others in the form of
      a dream. At the beginning of the effect, you must name the recipient or
      identify him or her by some title that leaves no doubt as to identity. The
      messenger then enters a trance, appears in the intended recipient's dream,
      and delivers the message. The message can be of any length, and the
      recipient remembers it perfectly upon waking. The communication is
      one-way. The recipient cannot ask questions or offer information, nor can
      the messenger gain any information by observing the dreams of the
      recipient.

      </p>

      <p>Once the message is delivered, the messenger's mind returns instantly
      to its body. The duration of the power is the time required for the
      messenger to enter the recipient's dream and deliver the message.

      </p>

      <p>If the recipient is awake when the power begins, the messenger can
      choose to wake up (ending the effect) or remain in the trance. The
      messenger can remain in the trance until the recipient goes to sleep, then
      enter the recipient's dream and deliver the message as normal. A messenger
      that is disturbed during the trance comes awake, ending the effect.

      </p>

      <p>Creatures who don't sleep or don't dream cannot be

      contacted by this power.

      </p>

      <p>The messenger is unaware of its own surroundings or of the activities
      around it while in the trance. It is defenseless both physically and
      mentally (always failing any saving throw) while in the trance.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> If the recipient is awake when you begin to
      manifest the power, the messenger can choose to expend a number of power
      points (if the messenger is psionic) equal to the recipient's Hit Dice –4
      to plant the message, which the recipient receives when next she sleeps.
