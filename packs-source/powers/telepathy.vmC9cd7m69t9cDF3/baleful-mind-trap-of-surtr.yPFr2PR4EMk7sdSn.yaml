      <p>You set up a trap in your mind against mental intruders. Anyone who
      attacks you with a telepathy power or mindaffecting effect immediately
      loses 1d6 power points. This power's effect does not negate the power that
      is currently being used against you. You can manifest this power
      instantly, quickly enough to gain its benefit in an emergency. Creatures
      that do not have power points must make a Fortitude save or be nauseated
      for 1 round. Manifesting the power is an immediate action. You can use
      this power even when it is not your turn.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every additional power point you spend,
      this power's duration increases by 1 round.
