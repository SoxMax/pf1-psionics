    value: >-
      <p>You invade the target's mind and temporarily reduce its ability to ward
      off attacks. If the target succeeds at its saving throw, its hardiness is
      still depleted; the target takes 1 extra point of damage per die of damage
      it is dealt from melee or ranged attacks while the duration lasts. If it
      fails its save, it takes maximum damage plus 1 point of extra damage per
      die of damage it is dealt from melee or ranged attacks while the duration
      lasts. For instance, if a greatsword that normally deals 2d6 points of
      damage hits the target, they take 14 points of damage from the hit
      automatically.

      </p>

      <p>A target that knows that it is under the effect may spend a move action
      to make an additional Will save at the original save DC to attempt to
      reduce the effect to only taking 1 extra point of damage per die of damage
      it is dealt.
