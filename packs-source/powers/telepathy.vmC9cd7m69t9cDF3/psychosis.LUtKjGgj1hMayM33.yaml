      <p>Creatures affected by this power are permanently confused and
      constantly behave randomly, making them unable to independently determine
      what they will do. Roll on the following table at the beginning the
      subject's turn each round to see what the subject does in that round.

      </p><table><tr><th>d%

      </th><th>Behavior

      </th></tr><tr><td>01–25

      </td><td>Act normally

      </td></tr><tr><td>26–50

      </td><td>Do nothing but babble incoherently.

      </td></tr><tr><td>51–75

      </td><td>Deal 1d8 points of damage + Str modifier to self with item in
      hand

      </td></tr><tr><td>76–100

      </td><td>Attack nearest creature (for this purpose, a psicrystal counts as
      part of the subject's self).

      </td></tr></table>

      <p>A confused character that can't carry out the indicated action does
      nothing but babble incoherently. Attackers are not at any special
      advantage when attacking a confused character. Any confused character that
      is attacked automatically attacks its attackers on its next turn, as long
      as it is still confused when its turn comes. Note that a confused
      character will not make attacks of opportunity against any creature that
      it is not already devoted to attacking (either because of its most recent
      actions or because it has just been attacked).

      </p>

      <p>Only psychic chirurgery, reality revision, and other similarly extreme
      measures can restore the subject's sanity.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every 2 additional power points you
      spend, this power's save DC increases by 1, and the power can affect an
      additional target. Any additional target cannot be more than 15 feet from
      another target of the power.
