      <p>You broadcast a mental compulsion that convinces one or more creatures
      of a combined total of 4 Hit Dice or less that they are disabled.
      Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first. Among creatures with
      equal Hit Dice, those who are closest to the power's point of origin are
      affected first. Hit Dice that are not sufficient to affect a creature are
      wasted.

      </p>

      <p>Creatures that are rendered helpless or are destroyed when they reach 0
      hit points cannot be affected. Creatures affected by this power believe
      that they have somehow been brought to the brink of unconsciousness and
      must act accordingly. While it's possible for an important nonplayer
      character to attempt some sort of "heroic" action, common NPCs and
      creatures under the effect of this power

      typically cower or retreat.

      </p>

      <p>Any creature that attempts to take a standard action immediately breaks
      the compulsion and can act normally. A creature that attempts to heal
      itself or that receives healing is likewise freed of the compulsion, and
      if it is not actually wounded, the healing is wasted. A creature that
      takes damage is also instantly freed of the compulsion (although the
      damage still counts against its actual current hit points).

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every 2 additional power points you
      spend, this power's range increases by 5 feet and its save DC increases by
      1.

      </p>

      <p>In addition, for every additional power point you spend to increase the
      range and the save DC, this power can affect targets that have Hit Dice
      equal to 4 + the number of additional points.
