      <p>Swift tendrils of thought disrupt the unconscious mind of any one
      creature, sapping its might. As long as the manifester remains
      concentrating fully on this power, the subject is confused, making it
      unable to independently determine what it will do. Roll on the following
      table at the beginning of each of the subject's turns to see what the
      subject does in that round.

      </p><table><tr><th>d%

      </th><th>Behavior

      </th></tr><tr><td>01–25

      </td><td>Act normally

      </td></tr><tr><td>26–50

      </td><td>Do nothing but babble incoherently.

      </td></tr><tr><td>51–75

      </td><td>Deal 1d8 points of damage + Str modifier to self with item in
      hand

      </td></tr><tr><td>76–100

      </td><td>Attack nearest creature (for this purpose, a psicrystal counts as
      part of the subject's self).

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every 2 additional power points you
      spend, this power's save DC increases by 1, and the power can affect an
      additional target. Any additional target cannot be more than 15 feet from
      another target of the power.
