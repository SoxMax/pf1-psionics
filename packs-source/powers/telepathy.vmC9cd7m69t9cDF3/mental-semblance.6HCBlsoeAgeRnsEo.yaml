    value: >-
      <p>When manifesting this power, you are capable of duplicating the psionic
      pattern of an individual you’ve touched and attempt to duplicate them.
      This is a mind-affecting ability that causes those who view you to see and
      hear you as the duplicated individual, granting you a +30 competence bonus
      on Disguise and Bluff checks to appear and act like the duplicated
      individual. You may duplicate patterns that are similar to your own;
      creatures duplicated must be of same type and size or within one step
      smaller or larger, and must have the same configuration of limbs (if you
      duplicate someone with a missing limb, observers will see that this limb
      is missing still). This power only affects the senses of sight and sound,
      you will still smell the same and creatures with scent may pick up the
      difference. Individuals who perceive falsehood in your disguise and
      representation of the duplicated victim may attempt a Will save to
      disbelieve the power and see through it. However, this does not end the
      power, only allowing the creature making the save to see through it to
      what you really are.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment: </strong>If you spend an additional 2 power points
      points, the bonus on Bluff and Disguise checks increase by 2 and the DC to
      disbelieve the disguise increases by 1.
