      <p>When manifesting this power, you create a subtle psionic field around
      your mind blade (or any of its variant types) and strike out at an enemy
      as a standard action. Your successful attack causes this field to
      discharge and inflict an additional 2d6 points of nonlethal damage.
      Additionally, this power stuns foes on a failed Will save for 1d4 rounds.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every additional 2 power points spent,
      increase the damage by 1d6 and increase the stun duration by 1 round. For
      every 4 additional power points spent on this power, increase the Will
      save DC by 1.
