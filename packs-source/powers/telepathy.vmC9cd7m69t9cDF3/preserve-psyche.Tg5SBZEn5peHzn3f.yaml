  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You preserve the mind of the slain creature, keeping it from
      permanently departing from its body. This power must be manifested as soon
      as the creature is slain, although subsequent manifestations can be used
      to extend the duration of the effect. This effect takes place before the
      creature is removed from the collective due to the creature's death. For
      the duration of this effect, the slain creature can be affected by psionic
      revivify as if it had died within 1 round, but psionic revivify must be
      channeled through specially-treated crystals similar to cognizance
      crystals that cost 5,000 gp. The psionic energy in the crystal is consumed
      in the manifestation and the crystal becomes inert and has no value.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> If you spend 6 additional power points, you
      can affect a creature that was in your collective when it died for up to
      24 hours after its death.
