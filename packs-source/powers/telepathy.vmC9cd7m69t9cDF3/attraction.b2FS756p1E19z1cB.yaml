      <p>You plant a compelling attraction in the mind of the subject. The
      attraction can be toward a particular person or an object. The subject
      will take reasonable steps to meet, get close to, attend, or find the
      object of its implanted attraction. For the purpose of this power,
      "reasonable" means that, while attracted, the subject doesn't suffer from
      blind obsession. He will act on this attraction only when not engaged in
      combat. The subject won't perform obviously suicidal actions. He can still
      recognize danger but will not flee unless the threat is immediate. If you
      make the subject feel an attraction to yourself, you can't command him
      indiscriminately, although he will be willing to listen to you (even if he
      disagrees). This power grants you a +4 bonus on any interaction checks you
      make involving the subject (such as Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, and
      Sense Motive).

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every 2 additional power points you
      spend, this power's save DC increases by 1 and the bonus on interaction
      checks increases by 1.
