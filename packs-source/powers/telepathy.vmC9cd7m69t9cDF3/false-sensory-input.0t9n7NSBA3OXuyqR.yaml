      <p>You have a limited ability to falsify one of the subject's senses. The
      subject thinks she sees, hears, smells, tastes, or feels something other
      than what her senses actually report. You can't create a sensation where
      none exists, nor make the subject completely oblivious to a sensation, but
      you can replace the specifics of one sensation with different specifics.
      For instance, you could make a human look like a dwarf (or one human look
      like another specific human), a closed door look like it is open, a vat of
      acid smell like rose water, a parrot look like a bookend, stale rations
      taste like fresh fruit, a light pat feel like a dagger thrust, a scream
      sound like the howling wind, and so on.

      </p>

      <p>You can switch between senses you falsify round by round. You can't
      alter the size of an object by more than 50% by using this power. Thus,
      you couldn't make a castle look like a hovel, but you could make it look
      like a different castle, or a rough hillock of approximately the same
      size. If this power is used to distract an enemy manifester who is
      attempting to use his powers, the enemy must make a concentration check as
      if being grappling or pinned.

      </p>

      <p>Because you override a victim's senses, you can fool a victim who is
      using true seeing or some other method of gathering information, assuming
      you know that the victim is actively using such an effect and you can
      maintain concentration.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every 2 additional power points you
      spend, this power can affect an additional target. Any additional target
      cannot be more than 15 feet from another target of the power.
