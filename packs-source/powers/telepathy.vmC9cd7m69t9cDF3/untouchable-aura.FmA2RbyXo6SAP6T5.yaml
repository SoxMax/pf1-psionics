  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You manifest an aura of nightmares around you which reacts to anyone
      trying to attack you in melee, forcing the assailant's worst nightmares to
      consume their thoughts.

      </p>

      <p>Anyone trying to make a melee attack against you must succeed on a Will
      save or lose their attack action as they recoil in fear from the images
      inside their mind. If the save succeeds, the opponent can attack normally
      and is unaffected by that manifestation of the power. Power resistance
      applies at the same time as a Will save.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> You can augment this power in one or more of
      the following ways.

      </p><ol><li>If you expend your psionic focus, the manifesting time becomes
      1 immediate action instead.</li><li>For every additional power point you
      spend, this power lasts for 1 additional round.</li><li>If you spend 4
      additional power points, this power affects anyone trying to attack you,
      regardless of how (any targeted powers or spells, melee or
      ranged).</li></ol>

      <p>In addition, for every 2 power points spent on the above augmentations,
      the save DC increases by 1.

      </p>
