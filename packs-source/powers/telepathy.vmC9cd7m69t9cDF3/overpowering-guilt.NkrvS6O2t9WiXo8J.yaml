      <p>You viciously pound on the mind of the target, triggering their inner
      guilt, allowing it to wash over them. This guilt takes on a different
      aspect for every target, from what they wish they had done, to guilt over
      what they actually did. Regardless, if they make their save, they take a
      –1 penalty to all their d20 rolls until the end of the duration. If they
      fail, they are also staggered during this time.

      <p><strong>Augment: </strong>This power may be augmented in one or more of
      the following ways.

      </p><ol><li>For every 2 additional power points you spend, the penalty
      increases by 1.</li><li>If you spend an 2 additional power points, this
      power can target one creature per level.</li><li>If you spend an 2
      additional power points, the range increases to Medium (100 ft. + 10
