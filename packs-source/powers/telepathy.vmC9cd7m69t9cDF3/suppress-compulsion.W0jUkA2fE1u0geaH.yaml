      <p>You can attempt to suppress a compulsion or charm effect on another
      creature by overwhelming the creature with conflicting telepathic signals,
      temporarily canceling the domination. When you manifest this power, make a
      manifester level check against the ongoing controlling power currently in
      effect on the creature. The manifester level check is 1d20 + your
      manifester level against a Difficulty Class of 11 + the manifester level
      of the entity that originally manifested the controlling power. On a
      successful check, the control is suppressed for 1 full round. Even though
      suppressed, the compulsion or charm is still considered to be running off
      its duration.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> You can augment this power in one or more of
      the following ways.

      </p><ol><li>If you spend 4 additional power points, you can attempt to
      permanently terminate a compulsion or charm effect on another creature,
      including mind control. When you manifest this power, make a manifester
      level check against the ongoing controlling power currently in effect on
      the creature against a Difficulty Class of 11 + the manifester level of
      the entity that originally manifested the controlling power. On a
      successful check, you terminate the effect.</li><li>For every additional
      power point you spend, you increase your check result by +1 and extend the
      duration by 1 round.</li></ol>
