      <p>You form a mental bond with one creature within range and use that bond
      to force minor hallucinations into the target's mind, hindering them in
      several potential ways.

      the duration of the power (your choice):

      </p><ul><li>Attack rolls</li><li>Saving throws</li><li>Ability checks and
      skill checks</li></ul>

      <p>A successful save reduces the penalty to -1.

      </p>

      the following ways.

      </p><ol><li>If you spend 2 additional power points, you may choose a
      second type of check to which the penalty applies.</li><li>For every 2
      additional power points you spend, the penalty increases by 1. For every
      two points the penalty increases, the penalty on a successful Will save
      increases by 1.</li></ol>

      <p>In addition, for every 2 power points spent to achieve either of these
      results, the power's save DC increases by 1.
