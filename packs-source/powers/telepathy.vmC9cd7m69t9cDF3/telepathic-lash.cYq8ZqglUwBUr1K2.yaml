      <p>Your mind lashes out, overwhelming your target with raging emotions,
      flooding their mind with memories and impulses they are hard pressed to
      control, rendering them unable to take any actions. Humanoids of 5 or more
      HD are not affected. The target is dazed; a dazed subject is not stunned,
      so attackers get no special advantage against it. After a creature has
      been dazed by this power, it is immune to the effects of this power for 1
      minute.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> This power can be augmented in one or more of
      the following ways.

      </p><ol><li>For every additional power point you spend, this power can
      affect a target that has Hit Dice equal to 4 + the additional
      points.</li><li>For every additional power point you spend, increase the
      duration of the effect by 1 round. If you spend 6 additional power points
      in this fashion, the target is instead stunned for 1 round.</li></ol>

      <p>Additionally, for every two additional power points spent on either of
      the above options, this power's save DC increases by 1.
