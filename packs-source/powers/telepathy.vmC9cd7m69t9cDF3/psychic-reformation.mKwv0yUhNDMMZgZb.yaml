      <p>When this power is manifested, the subject can choose to spend its most
      recently gained skill ranks differently (picking new skills and abandoning
      old ones if it chooses) and to choose a different feat from the one it
      selected when advancing from its previous level to its current level.

      </p>

      <p>The subject can also choose to forget powers or spells it acquired when
      advancing to its current level, replacing them with new ones.

      </p>

      <p>The subject can undo decisions of these sorts that were made at lower
      levels, although he suffers increased penalties the farther back he goes
      to undo decisions. The subject must abide by the standard rules for
      selecting skills and feats, and so it cannot take feats for which it
      doesn't qualify. Any change made must have been available at the level
      selected. For example, a 7th level psion who uses this power to change a
      2nd level power gained at 3rd level psion cannot select a 4th level power
      to replace it – he must choose a 1st or 2nd level power.

      </p>

      <p>The subject is not limited to changing only a single level's choices
      should he decide to undo decisions from prior levels. Every level between
      his current level and the earliest level may be altered, so long as the
      choices made were valid at the appropriate level.

      </p>

      <p>If the subject goes farther back than the changes from the previous
      level to its current level, the subject suffers a cumulative –1 penalty on
      all ability checks, attack rolls, combat maneuver checks, Combat Maneuver
      Defense, saving throws, and skill checks for each level back the power
      changes. In addition, the creature reduces its current and total hit
      points by 5 for each level back the power changes. The creature is also
      treated as one level lower for the purpose of level-dependent variables
      (such as spellcasting or manifesting) for each level back the power
      changes. These penalties last for 24 hours.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> This power may be augmented in either of the
      following ways.

      </p><ol><li>If you spend 2 additional power points, the penalties end
      after the subject rests for 8 hours.</li><li>If you spend 6 additional
      power points, the subject does not suffer any penalties.</li></ol>
