      <p>The power overwhelms the target's mind and ability to concentrate,
      making manifesting powers or casting spells extremely hard. The subject
      must succeed at a concentration check (DC equal to the save DC of this
      power) in order to cast a spell, manifest a power, use any spell-like
      ability use any psi-like ability, or use any spell completion, power
      completion, power trigger or spell trigger magic items.

      </p>

      <p>While under the effect of this power, if the subject must attempt a
      concentration check to cast a spell, manifest a power, use a psi-like
      ability or a spell-like ability for any reason other than the effect of
      this spell (such as manifesting defensively, being injured while
      manifesting, and so on), it takes a penalty on that check equal to 1/2 its
      caster or manifester level.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> This power can be augmented in one or more of
      the following ways.

      another target.</li><li>If you spend 2 additional power points, the range
      increases to Medium instead of Close.</li><li>If you spend 3 additional
      power points, the target takes a penalty to all concentration checks equal
      to your manifesting ability stat, in addition to any other penalties it
      might suffer.</li></ol>
