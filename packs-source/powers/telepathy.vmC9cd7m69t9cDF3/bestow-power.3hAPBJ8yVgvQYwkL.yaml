      <p>You link your mind with another psionic creature's mind, creating a
      brief conduit through which mental energy can be shared. When you manifest
      this power, the subject gains up to 2 power points. You can transfer only
      as many power points to a subject as it has manifester levels.

      </p>

      <p>Because of the intimate nature of this power, it cannot be fabricated
      into a psionic item—only power points generated by a psionic creature in
      the moment can be shared using bestow power.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> The power point cost of this power cannot be
      reduced below the number of power points transferred. All points
      transferred must be deducted from the manifester's pool of power points;
      sources such as wild surge cannot pay for this effect. This power is not
      subject to the effects of affinity field.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every 3 additional power points you
      spend, the subject gains 2 additional power points.
