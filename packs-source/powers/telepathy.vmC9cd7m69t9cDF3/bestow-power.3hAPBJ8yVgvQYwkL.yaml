      <p>You link your mind with another psionic creature's mind, creating a
      brief conduit through which mental energy can be shared. When you manifest
      this power, the subject gains up to [[2+@augments.amplify]] power points.
      You can transfer only as many power points to a subject as it has
      manifester levels.</p><p>Because of the intimate nature of this power, it
      cannot be fabricated into a psionic item—only power points generated by a
      psionic creature in the moment can be shared using bestow
      power.</p><p><strong>Special:</strong> The power point cost of this power
      cannot be reduced below the number of power points transferred. All points
      transferred must be deducted from the manifester's pool of power points;
      sources such as wild surge cannot pay for this effect. This power is not
      subject to the effects of
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1-psionics.powers.Item.lEl3FpFuNmgC0MPY].</p><p><strong>Augment:</strong>
      For every 3 additional power points you spend, the subject gains 2
      additional power points.</p>
