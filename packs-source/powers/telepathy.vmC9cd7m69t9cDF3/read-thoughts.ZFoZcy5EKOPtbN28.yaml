      <p>You know the surface thoughts of the mind of any creature in the area
      that fails a Will save. A target that succeeds on its save is not affected
      by this manifestation of the power, even if it leaves the area and then
      reenters the area before the duration expires.

      </p>

      <p>Creatures of animal intelligence have simple, instinctual thoughts that
      you can pick up. If you read the thoughts of a creature with an
      Intelligence of 26 or higher (and at least 10 points higher than your own
      Intelligence score), you are stunned for 1 round and the power ends. This
      power does not let you pinpoint the location of an affected mind if you
      don't have line of sight to the subject.

      </p>

      <p>Each round, you can turn to use this power in a new area. The power can
      penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin
      sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every 2 additional power points you
      spend, this power's save DC increases by 1.
