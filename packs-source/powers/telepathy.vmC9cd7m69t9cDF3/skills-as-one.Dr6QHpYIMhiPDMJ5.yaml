      <p>When manifesting this power, you must choose one skill. If your rank in
      that skill is higher, the target uses your ranks in place of his own ranks
      (maximum 5 ranks), and vice versa. If a target's skill ranks are replaced
      by this power, they are treated as though they actually had the shared
      ranks in the skill for all purposes (including class skill bonuses and the
      use of trained-only skills).

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> You can augment this power in one or more of
      the following ways.

      </p><ol><li>For every 2 additional power points you spend, you can choose
      an additional skill to share. Compare each skill individually.</li><li>For
      every 2 additional power points you spend, the maximum ranks you can share
      increases by 5 ranks.</li><li>If you spend 2 additional power points, this
      power can affect an unwilling target, and the power's saving throw becomes
      "Will negates (harmless)". Unwilling targets do not gain the benefit of
      increased skill ranks, although their skill ranks may be shared with
      willing targets.</li></ol>
