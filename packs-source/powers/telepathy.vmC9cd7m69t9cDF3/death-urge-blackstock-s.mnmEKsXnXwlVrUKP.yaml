      <p>You plant a hidden death-urge impulse in the subject's unconscious. On
      the subject's next turn, it looks for the quickest method to end its life
      and attempts to do so. The subject takes no other action on its turn
      except attempting to harm itself.

      </p>

      <p>If armed, the subject attacks itself as a full-round action. The attack
      automatically succeeds and deals damage as a critical hit. If unarmed, the
      subject moves adjacent to the nearest enemy and provokes an attack of
      opportunity, offering its opponent an opening, which the opponent may or
      may not choose to take advantage of.

      </p>

      <p>If the subject is unarmed and no enemy is nearby, the subject simply
      does nothing at all. A subject close to an immediate and lethal hazard
      such as a cliff or a fire might hurl itself off the cliff or into the fire
      instead of striking itself with a weapon.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every 2 additional power points you
      spend, this power's save DC increases by 1. For every 2 point increase in
      the power's save DC, the duration increases by 1 round.
