  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You can attempt to take control of a nearby living creature, forcing
      your mind (and soul) into its body, and its mind into your body. You can
      target any creature whose Hit Dice are equal to or less than your
      manifester level.

      </p>

      <p>You possess the target's body and force the creature's mind into your
      body unless it succeeds on a Will save. You can move your mind back into
      your own body whenever you desire, which returns the subject's mind to its
      own body and ends the power. If the manifestation succeeds, your life
      force occupies the host body, and the host's life force takes over yours.

      </p>

      <p>You can call on rudimentary or instinctive knowledge of the subject
      creature, but not upon its acquired or learned knowledge (such as skills
      and feats it possesses). The same is true for the subject in your body.
      The mind switch brings about the following changes.

      </p><ul><li>You gain the type of your assumed body.</li><li>You gain the
      Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores of your assumed
      body.</li><li>You gain the natural armor, natural attacks, movement, and
      other simple physical characteristics of your assumed body.</li><li>You
      gain the extraordinary special attacks and qualities of your assumed body,
      but you do not gain supernatural or spell-like abilities, nor do you gain
      any class abilities of the assumed body. Any racial trait which relies
      upon power points, such as the elan's resilience trait, is considered to
      be a supernatural ability.</li><li>You gain the possessions and equipment
      of your assumed body.</li><li>You retain your own hit points and saving
      throws (both possibly modified by new ability scores), class abilities,
      supernatural and spell-like abilities, spells and powers, and skills and
      feats (although skill checks use your new ability scores, and you may be
      temporarily unable to use feats whose requirements you do not meet in your
      new body). You retain any racial abilities, so long as they are not based
      upon your original form (for example, the dromite's chitin is based upon
      his physical body, so would not be retained).</li><li>You suffer one
      negative level while in your assumed body.</li></ul>

      <p>Supernatural abilities that require a certain body part may be
      unavailable in your new form.

      </p>

      <p>If either body is killed while the power is in effect, the other
      participant also dies when the power ends. If one participant's body
      becomes petrified, imprisoned by temporal stasis or imprisonment, or
      incapacitated in some other way, the other participant will be
      incapacitated in that way when the power ends.

      </p>

      <p>A targeted dispel psionics (or similar spells or effects) successfully
      manifested on either participant causes both minds to return to their
      original bodies.

      </p>

      <p>If you successfully use mind switch while already under the effect of
      mind switch, the original target is returned to its original body, the new
      target occupies your original body, and you occupy the body of the new
      target.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every 2 additional power points you
      spend, this power's save DC increases by 1.
