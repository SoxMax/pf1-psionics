  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You create a mental image of the most fearsome creature imaginable to
      the subject simply by forming the fears of the subject's subconscious mind
      into something that its conscious mind can visualize: this most horrible
      beast. Only the power's subject can see the nightmarish beast. The target
      first gets a Will save to recognize the image as unreal. If that save
      fails, the beast touches the subject, and the subject must succeed on a
      Fortitude save or die from fear. Even if the Fortitude save is successful,
      the subject takes 3d6 points of damage.

      </p>

      <p>If the subject of a deadly fear attack succeeds in disbelieving and
      possesses telepathy or is wearing a helm of telepathy, the effect can be
      turned upon you. You must then disbelieve it or become subject to the
      deadly fear attack.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every 2 additional power points spent,
      both Difficulty Classes increase by 1. For every 5 additional power points
      spent, you can attempt to affect one additional creature. If affecting
      more than one creature, no two can be more than 30 feet apart.
