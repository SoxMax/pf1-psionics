    value: >-
      <p>You cause a psionic slumber to come upon 4 HD of creatures. Creatures
      with the fewest HD are affected first. Among creatures with equal HD,
      those who are closest to the power's point of origin are affected first.
      HD that are not sufficient to affect a creature are wasted. Sleeping
      creatures are helpless. Slapping or wounding awakens an affected creature,
      but normal noise does not. Awakening a creature is a standard action (an
      application of the aid another action). Slumber does not target
      unconscious creatures, constructs, or undead creatures.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every additional power point you spend,
      you increase the number of Hit Dice affected by one. If you instead spend
      11 additional power points, you affect every creature within the power's
      area, regardless of individual or total Hit Dice.
