    value: >-
      <p>You forge a passive mental link with a creature with which you have
      previously had physical or mental contact. The subject need not be within
      sight or even on the same plane as you are. The subject recognizes you,
      and you can mentally communicate with it for the duration (though nothing
      forces the subject to respond to you), exchanging messages of twenty-five
      words or less once per round. Receiving a message is not an action and
      does not provoke attacks of opportunity; however, sending a message is
      equivalent to a standard action that can provoke attacks of opportunity.
      You do not need line of sight or line of effect to use this power.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> If you spend an additional 4 power points,
      the power's duration increases to 10 minutes/level.
