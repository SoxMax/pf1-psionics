    value: >-
      <p>You numb the mind of the target, making their thoughts unfocused and
      imprecise. This makes the target harder to affect with any mind-affecting
      abilities, but if they are casters or manifesters, they can’t use their
      mind to its fullest potential. The target gains a +4 bonus to saves
      against any mind-affecting abilities, spells or powers, but lose access to
      the highest level of spells, powers, spell-like abilities or psi-like
      abilities they possess. For example: Wayana, a 6th level sorcerer is
      targeted by <em>numbed mind </em>and fails her Will-save. For the duration
      of the power, she gains a +4 bonus to her saves against other
      mind-affecting abilities but cannot cast her 3rd level spells.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment: </strong>This power may be augmented in one or more of
      the following ways.

      </p><ol><li>If you spend 4 additional power points, the duration becomes 1
      minute / level.</li><li>For every additional power point you spend, you
      can target another creature.</li><li>If you spend 8 additional power
      points, the duration becomes permanent, but the target gets a new save
      (without the bonus) after having slept for at least 8 hours for as long as
      the power is in effect.</li></ol>
