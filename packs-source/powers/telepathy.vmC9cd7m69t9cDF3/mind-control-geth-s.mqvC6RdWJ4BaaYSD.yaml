    value: >-
      <p>You can control the actions of any humanoid creature through a
      telepathic link that you establish with the subject's mind.

      </p>

      <p>If you and the subject have a common language, you can generally force
      the subject to perform as you desire, within the limits of its abilities.
      If no common language exists, you can communicate only basic commands,
      such as "Come here," "Go there," "Fight," and "Stand still." You know what
      the subject is experiencing, but you do not receive direct sensory input
      from it, nor can it communicate with you telepathically.

      </p>

      <p>Once you have given a controlled creature a command, it continues to
      attempt to carry out that command to the exclusion of all other activities
      except those necessary for day-to-day survival (such as sleeping, eating,
      and so forth). Because of this limited range of activity, a Sense Motive
      check against DC 15 (rather than DC 25) can determine that the subject's
      behavior is being influenced by an enchantment effect (see the Sense
      Motive skill description).

      </p>

      <p>Changing your orders or giving a dominated creature a new command is a
      move action.

      </p>

      <p>By concentrating fully on the power (a standard action), you can
      receive full sensory input as interpreted by the mind of the subject,
      though it still can't telepathically communicate with you. You can't
      actually see through the subject's eyes, so it's not as good as being
      there yourself, but you still get a good idea of what's going on.

      </p>

      <p>Subjects resist this control, and any subject forced to take actions
      against its nature receives a new saving throw with a +2 bonus. Obviously
      self-destructive orders are not carried out. Once control is established,
      the range at which it can be exercised is unlimited, as long as you and
      the subject are on the same plane. You need not see the subject to control
      it.

      </p>

      <p>If you don't spend at least 1 round concentrating on the power each
      day, the subject receives a new saving throw to throw off the mind
      control.

      </p>

      <p>Protection from evil or a similar effect can prevent you from
      exercising control or using the telepathic link while the subject is so
      warded, but such an effect does not automatically dispel it.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> You can augment this power in one or more of
      the following ways.

      </p><ol><li>If you spend 2 additional power points, this power can also
      affect an animal, fey, magical beast, or monstrous humanoid.</li><li>If
      you spend 4 additional power points, this power can also affect an
      aberration, dragon, elemental, or outsider in addition to the creature
      types mentioned above.</li><li>For every 2 additional power points you
      spend, this power can affect an additional target. Any additional target
      cannot be more than 15 feet from another target of the power.</li></ol>

      <p>In addition, for every 2 additional power points you spend to achieve
      any of these effects, this power's save DC increases by 1.
