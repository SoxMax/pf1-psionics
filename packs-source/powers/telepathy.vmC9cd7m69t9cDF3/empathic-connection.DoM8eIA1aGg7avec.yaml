      <p>You reach out with your mind, finding the emotional strings that most
      apply to your target. With delicate influences, you twist those emotional
      strings, making your target view you as a friend (treat the target's
      attitude as friendly). If the creature is currently being threatened or
      attacked by you or your allies, however, it receives a +5 bonus on its
      saving throw.</p><p>This does not enable you to control the affected
      person as if it was an automaton, but it perceives your words and actions
      in the most favorable way. You can try to give the subject orders, but you
      must win an opposed Charisma check to convince it to do anything it
      wouldn't ordinarily do. (Retries are not allowed.) An affected creature
      never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful orders, but it might be
      convinced that something very dangerous is worth doing. Any act by you or
      your apparent allies that threatens the charmed person breaks the effect.
      You must speak the person's language to communicate your commands, be good
      at pantomiming, or have some other method to communicate, such as
      mindlink.</p><p><strong>Augment:</strong> You can augment this power in
      one or more of the following ways.</p><ol><li>If you spend 2 additional
      power points, this power can also affect an animal, fey, magical beast, or
      monstrous humanoid.</li><li>If you spend 4 additional power points, this
      power can also affect an aberration, dragon, elemental, or outsider in
      addition to the creature types mentioned above.</li><li>If you spend 4
      additional power points, this power's duration increases to one day per
      level.</li></ol><p>In addition, for every 2 additional power points you
      spend to achieve any of these effects, this power's save DC increases by
      1.</p>
