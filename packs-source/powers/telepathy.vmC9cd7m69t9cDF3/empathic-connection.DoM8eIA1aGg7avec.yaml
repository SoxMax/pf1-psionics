      <p>You reach out with your mind, finding the emotional strings that most
      apply to your target. With delicate influences, you twist those emotional
      strings, making your target view you as a friend (treat the target's
      attitude as friendly). If the creature is currently being threatened or
      attacked by you or your allies, however, it receives a +5 bonus on its
      saving throw.

      </p>

      <p>This does not enable you to control the affected person as if it was an
      automaton, but it perceives your words and actions in the most favorable
      way. You can try to give the subject orders, but you must win an opposed
      Charisma check to convince it to do anything it wouldn't ordinarily do.
      (Retries are not allowed.) An affected creature never obeys suicidal or
      obviously harmful orders, but it might be convinced that something very
      dangerous is worth doing. Any act by you or your apparent allies that
      threatens the charmed person breaks the effect. You must speak the
      person's language to communicate your commands, be good at pantomiming, or
      have some other method to communicate, such as mindlink.

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> You can augment this power in one or more of
      the following ways.

      </p><ol><li>If you spend 2 additional power points, this power can also
      affect an animal, fey, magical beast, or monstrous humanoid.</li><li>If
      you spend 4 additional power points, this power can also affect an
      aberration, dragon, elemental, or outsider in addition to the creature
      types mentioned above.</li><li>If you spend 4 additional power points,
      this power's duration increases to one day per level. In addition, for
      every 2 additional power points you spend to achieve any of these effects,
      this power's save DC increases by 1.</li></ol>
