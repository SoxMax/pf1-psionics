      <p>You impress the totality of your psyche into a subject's subconscious.
      If successfully implanted, the seed of your mind "germinates" over the
      period of one week. During this time, the subject begins to unconsciously
      take on your mannerisms.

      </p>

      <p>When integration is complete (after one week), the subject becomes you
      in mind as you were when you manifested the power, but the subject's level
      is eight lower than your own. The subject does not have any of your
      physical ability scores or equipment, but does have the Intelligence,
      Wisdom, and Charisma scores you had when you were eight levels lower. The
      subject also knows the powers you knew when you were eight levels lower.
      If the subject's race is different from yours, its racial traits do not
      change.

      </p>

      <p>While the subject is initially your mental duplicate, the two
      personalities diverge over time. Although the subject starts off with
      memories of your experiences, it possesses its original "soul" and
      physical body and is free to develop its own personality based on its own
      new experiences. Thus, the subject is not your slave or servant, but
      instead a nonplayer character in its own right that shares your earlier
      memories.

      </p>

      <p>Protection from evil or a similar spell or power can prevent you from
      implanting mind seed, or prevent a seed from germinating while the
      protective power lasts. Otherwise, a germinating seed can be removed
      (prior to germination) only by psychic chirurgery, reality revision, or
      similarly high-level effects. Manifesting mind seed again during the
      germination period also cleanses the subject's mind and does not carry
      with it the restriction of a target of your size or smaller

      </p>

      <p>The process of impressing your psyche into another is demanding and
      draining. You suffer one negative level that does not go away until
      cleansed by an effect such as restoration. Cleansing a mind seed does not
      bestow this penalty.

      </p>

      <p>The target of this power must be your size or smaller. Effects active
      that modify your size do not modify this restriction; if you are normally
      Medium size, but under the effect of expansion, you may still only target
      a Medium or smaller humanoid.

      </p>

      <p>This power does not have the evil descriptor when used to cleanse a
      mind seed.
