  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You compel the subject to purge its entire store of air in one
      explosive exhalation, and thereby disrupt the subject's autonomic
      breathing cycle. The subject's lungs do not automatically function again
      while the power's duration lasts.

      </p>

      <p>If the target succeeds on a Will save when crisis of breath is
      manifested, it is unaffected by this power. If it fails its Will save, it
      can still continue to breathe by taking a standard action in each round to
      gasp for breath.

      </p>

      <p>An affected creature can attempt to take actions normally (instead of
      consciously controlling its breathing), but each round it does so,
      beginning in the round when it failed its Will save, the subject risks
      blacking out from lack of oxygen. It must succeed on a Fortitude save at
      the end of any of its turns in which it did not consciously take a breath.
      The DC of this save increases by 1 in every consecutive round after the
      first one that goes by without a breath; the DC drops back to its original
      value if the subject spends an action to take a breath.

      </p>

      <p>If a subject fails a Fortitude save, it is disabled (0 hp). In the
      following round, it drops to –1 hit points and is dying. Curing powers or
      spells can revive a dying subject normally, so long as this power's
      duration has expired; if the power is still in effect, a revived creature
      is still subject to Fortitude saves in each round when it does not
      consciously breathe.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> You can augment this power in one or more of
      the following ways.

      </p><ol><li>If you spend 2 additional power points, this power can also
      affect an animal, fey, magical beast, or monstrous humanoid.</li><li>If
      you spend 4 additional power points, this power can also affect an
      aberration, dragon, elemental, or outsider in addition to the creature
      types mentioned above.</li><li>If you spend 6 additional power points,
      this power can affect up to four creatures all within a 20-ft.-radius
      burst.</li></ol>

      <p>In addition, for every 2 additional power points you spend to achieve
      any of these effects, this power's save DC increases by 1.
