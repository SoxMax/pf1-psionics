    value: >-
      <p>You forge a specialized telepathic connection between yourself and one
      ally. Whenever the target must make a Will save, you make the save instead
      as if the effect targeted you. If you fail in the saving throw, your ally
      suffers the consequences of the effect that forced the Will save and you
      must make an additional Will save at the same DC or be stunned for one
      round. The target may willingly fail saves against harmless powers without
      causing you to be stunned. Once the connection is forged, you can make
      Will saves for your ally as long as she remains in range. If she strays
      out of range, the power ends. You may not willingly fail a save when using
      psychic bodyguard, but you may allow the target to make her own save. The
      power immediately ends after you have made a successful Will save for the
      target.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> This power may be augmented in one or more of
      the following ways.

      </p><ol><li>For every additional 2 power points spent, the power lasts for
      one additional successful Will save.</li><li>If you spend 8 additional
      power points, the power is not discharged after making a successful Will
      save.</li></ol>
