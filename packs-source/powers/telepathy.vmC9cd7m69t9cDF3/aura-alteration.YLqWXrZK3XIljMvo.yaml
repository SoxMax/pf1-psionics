      <p>You can use this power in one of two ways: to disguise the subject's
      aura (alignment) and level, or to remove a compulsion or charm effect from
      the subject.

      </p><ul><li><em>Disguise:</em> If you use this power to disguise the
      subject's alignment and level, the power has a duration of 10 minutes per
      level. You can change the subject's alignment by only one step. You can
      adjust the subject's apparent level up or down by a number equal to 1/2
      your own level (rounded down) or less.</li></ul>

      <ul><li><em>Remove Compulsion:</em> If you use this power to attempt to
      cleanse the subject's aura of a baleful or controlling effect, the
      duration is instantaneous. This power can remove the compulsion of a curse
      or a geas/quest effect. It can also negate any charm and compulsion powers
      or spells of 6th level or lower, such as crisis of breath or death urge.
      When aura alteration is manifested for this purpose, the subject gains
      another saving throw to remove the compulsion afflicting it against the
      original save DC, but with a +2 bonus.</li></ul>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> You can augment this power in one of the

      following ways.

      </p><ol><li>For every additional power point you spend, the duration of
      the disguise aura increases by 10 minutes.</li><li>If you spend 2
      additional power points, the subject's alignment shifts an additional
      step; if you spend 4 additional power points, the subject's alignment
      changes to its opposite.</li><li>For every 3 additional power points you
      spend, the bonus against the original save is increased by 1.</li></ol>
