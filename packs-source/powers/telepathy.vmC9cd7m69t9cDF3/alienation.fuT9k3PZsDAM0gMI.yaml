      <p>You close off the centers of the subject's mind that deal with
      communication and social interaction. The subject effectively loses
      knowledge of all languages (including telepathic and body language) and is
      treated as illiterate for the duration of the power. He may still "speak"
      and provide verbal components, and to him they sound completely normal,
      but to anyone else they appear as complete gibberish.

      </p>

      <p>The subject is unable to understand anyone else on any level and is
      unable to determine friend from foe. This prevents things such as Sense
      Motive, the Aid Another action (or benefits from another's Aid Another),
      any skill check involving communication (including Linguistics), using
      teamwork feats, knowing if a magical effect used on him is harmless or not
      until it hits him (thus, he attempts a save against all effects he could)
      unless he makes a successful Spellcraft check to identify the effect,
      gaining the benefits from abilities such as bardic performance, or using
      any Charisma-based skill check (except Use Magic Device). The target no
      longer counts as an ally for the purposes of determining flanking and all
      creatures who threaten the subject are considered allies for their own
      flanking purposes. In addition, the subject cannot make attacks of
      opportunity while under this effect.

      </p>

      <p>The subject still understands if his attacks or powers are successful.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every additional power point you spend,
      this power may affect an additional target. No two targets may be further
      than 15 feet apart. For every 2 power points spent this way, the power's
      save DC increases by 1.
