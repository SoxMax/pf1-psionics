    value: >-
      <p>You tune your voice to the empathic vibrations of your target, making
      the next words you speak seem very convincing (limited to a sentence or
      two). The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the
      activity sound reasonable. Asking the creature to do some obviously
      harmful act automatically negates the effect of the power.

      </p>

      <p>The suggested course of activity can continue for the entire duration.
      If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the power
      ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do. You can instead
      specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the
      duration. If the condition is not met before the power duration expires,
      the activity is not performed.

      </p>

      <p>A very reasonable suggestion causes the save to be made with a penalty
      (such as –1 or –2).

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every 2 additional power points you
      spend, this power can affect an additional target and the power's save DC
      increases by 1. Any additional target cannot be more than 15 feet from
      another target of the power.
