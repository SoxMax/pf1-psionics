      <p>You telepathically charge your speech and hearing, allowing you to
      understand an additional language when it is spoken, even if it is a
      racial tongue or a regional dialect, and allowing your speech to be
      understood in that language. When you manifest this power, choose a
      language or a creature you want to understand and that you want to
      understand you. Any other creature that also understands the same language
      can understand you and you can understand them. This does not enable you
      to speak with creatures who don't speak. You can make yourself understood
      as far as your voice carries. This power does not predispose any creature
      addressed toward you in any way. This power does not enable you to speak
      with creatures immune to mind-affecting powers.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every additional power point you spend,
      you may understand and be understood in an additional language at the same
      time while this effect is active.
