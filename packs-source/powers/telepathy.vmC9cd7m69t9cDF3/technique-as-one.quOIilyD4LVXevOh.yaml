    value: >-
      <p>When you manifest this power, pick one feat that either you or the
      target has. This feat cannot be one restricted to first-level characters,
      nor can it have a racial prerequisite. All willing targets of this power
      gain this feat for the duration of the power, although they must meet all
      prerequisites of that feat to gain its benefits.

      </p>

      <p>Feats that directly modify hit points, power points, or spells per day
      cannot be chosen this way. If a feat requires a specific choice, that
      choice is also shared.

      </p>

      <p>This power does not grant you any special knowledge of the target's
      feats (though it is generally assumed that a willing target has filled you
      in on them beforehand). If your target does not actually have the feat you
      named, then the power fails.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> You can augment this power in one or more of

      the following ways.

      </p><ol><li>For every 2 additional power points you spend, you may share
      an additional feat from the same target. These feats can serve as
      prerequisites for other shared feats.</li><li>If you spend 2 additional
      power points, the power instead removes knowledge of the feat from the
      target and grants it to you. Targets of the power augmented in this way
      may attempt a Will saving throw each round to negate the effects of this
      power.</li></ol>
