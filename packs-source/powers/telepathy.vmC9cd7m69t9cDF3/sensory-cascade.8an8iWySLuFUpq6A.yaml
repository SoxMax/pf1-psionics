      <p>You overload the target's sensory system. In effect, the cascade buries
      the senses of the target creatures (even those with blindsight,
      tremorsense, touchsight, or other esoteric methods of sensing the
      environment) with random sensations for the duration. The creatures are
      treated as if blinded. However, from round to round, an affected creature
      has a chance to sense normally. Each round on the creature's action, roll
      1d4. On a roll of 1-3, the target does nothing for 1 round as it stands
      attempting to re-establish contact with its senses. Rolling a 4 frees the
      creature of the effect for 1 round.

      </p>

      <p>Sense-blocked creatures that are attacked (and damaged) are shocked out
      of their sense deprivation for 1 round - they can attack or attempt to
      flee however they desire on their next action. The following round they
      are subject once again to the sensory cascade (unless they are continually
      attacked each round).
