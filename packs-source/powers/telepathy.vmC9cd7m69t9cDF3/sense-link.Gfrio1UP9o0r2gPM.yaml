      <p>You perceive what the subject creature perceives using its sight,
      hearing, taste, or smell. Only one sense is linked, and you cannot switch
      between senses with the same manifestation.

      </p>

      <p>You make any skill checks involving senses, such as Perception, as the
      subject, and only within the subject's field of view. You lose your
      Dexterity bonus to AC while directly sensing what the subject senses.

      </p>

      <p>Once sense link is manifested, the link persists even if the subject
      moves out of the range of the original manifestation (but the link does
      not work across planes). You do not control the subject, nor can you
      communicate with it by means of this power.

      </p>

      <p>The strength of the subject's linked sense could be enhanced by other
      powers or items, allowing you the same enhanced sense. You are subject to
      any gaze attack affecting the subject creature (if you linked vision). If
      you are blinded or deafened, or suffer some other sensory deprivation, the
      linked creature functions as an independent sensory organ, and provides
      you the benefit of the linked sense from its perspective while this
      power's duration lasts.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> You can augment this power in one or more of
      the following ways.

      </p><ol><li>If you spend 2 additional power points, you can have the
      subject perceive one of your senses instead of the other way
      around.</li><li>If you spend 4 additional power points, you can link to a
      second sense of the same subject.</li><li>If you spend 2 additional power
      points, you can target an unwilling creature (Will save negates), but
      cannot augment this power in any other way. Treat the power as a 2nd level
      power when determining the save DC.</li></ol>
