      <p>You protect the subject's thoughts from analysis. While the duration
      lasts, the subject gains a +10 circumstance bonus on Bluff checks against
      those attempting to discern its true intentions with Sense Motive. It also
      gains a +4 bonus on its saving throw against any power or spell used to
      read its mind (such as read thoughts or mind probe).

      <p><em>Librarian Note:</em> Prior to Ultimate Psionics, this was both a
      psionic talent and a 1st-level psionic power. They are essentially the
      same power, with the only difference being that it was a 1st-level power
      for psions and psychic warriors. As such, they are both on the same page.
