      <p>You form a mental bond with a creature within range and use that bond
      to coordinate your attacks to throw your foes off balance.

      </p>

      <p>Creatures affected by this power may designate their own square or any
      square adjacent to them as the square they occupy for the purposes of
      flanking on their turn. If they occupy the designated square, they gain an
      additional +2 bonus from flanking.

      </p>

      <p>All targets gain some measure of awareness from other targets, guarding
      each other from external threats. If any target is aware of danger, all
      targets are. No target may be flat-footed or flanked unless all targets
      are.
