      <p>This power reflects the pinnacle of the network abilities — the
      unification of physical and mental traits in their purest form, ability
      scores. When you manifest this power, choose one of the six ability
      scores. The highest example of that score amongst the targets replaces the
      same ability score amongst all willing targets.

      </p>

      <p>Only base ability scores can be linked in this way — that is, the
      ability score without any bonuses or penalties of any type, except racial
      modifiers, age modifiers, inherent bonuses, and the bonuses every four
      character levels. Other effects that modify ability scores (such as
      spells, psionic powers, magic items, class features, and so on) are not
      transferred, though they remain in effect, altering any replaced score as
      they would alter the original.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> You may augment this power in one or both of
      the following ways.

      </p><ol><li>If you spend an additional 2 power points, you may instead
      share the lowest base ability score amongst all targets, willing or not
      (which may impact spellcasting in a way similar to ability damage).
      Unwilling targets may make a Will saving throw each round to ignore the
      effects of this power for that round. You are exempt from any ability
      score change this way.</li><li>For every 2 additional power points you
      spend, you may choose an additional ability score for this power to
      affect.</li></ol>

      <p>In addition, for every 2 power points spent to achieve either of these
      results, increase the save DC (if applicable) by 1.
