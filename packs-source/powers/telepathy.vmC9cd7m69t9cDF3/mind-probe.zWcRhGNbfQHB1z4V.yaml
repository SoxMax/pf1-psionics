      <p>All the subject's memories and knowledge are accessible to you, from
      memories deep below the surface to those still easily called to mind. You
      can learn the answer to one question per round, to the best of the
      subject's knowledge. If the subject succeeds on a Will save, it is not
      required to answer the question; however, making a save does not end the
      power. You can ask the subject a new question (or the same question) in
      subsequent rounds for as long as the power's duration persists.

      </p>

      <p>You can probe a sleeping subject and automatically get an answer to
      your question. If the subject then succeeds on a Will save, it wakes after
      providing the answer and thereafter can resist answering by making Will
      saves as described above.

      </p>

      <p>Subjects that do not wish to be probed can attempt to move beyond the
      power's range, unless they are somehow hindered. You pose the questions
      telepathically, and the answers to those questions are imparted directly
      to your mind. You and the subject do not need to speak the same language,
      though less intelligent creatures may yield up only appropriate visual
      images in answer to your questions.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> This power may be augmented in one or both of
      the following ways.

      </p><ol><li>If you spend 2 additional power points, the power's range
      increases to Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level).</li><li>For every 2
      additional power points you spend, the power's save DC increases by
      1.</li></ol>
