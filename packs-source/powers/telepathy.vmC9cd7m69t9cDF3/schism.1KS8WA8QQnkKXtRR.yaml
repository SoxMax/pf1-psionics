      <p>Your mind splits into two independent parts. Each part functions in
      complete autonomy, like two characters in one body. Your new "second mind"
      does not control your body physically but is free to take one standard
      action in each round if the action is purely mental (such as manifesting a
      power) in the same round you take your normal actions.

      </p>

      <p>Your second mind can manifest powers using your power point reserve,
      but only as if your manifester level were six lower than it is. Your
      second mind doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity when manifesting a
      power, because doing so doesn't distract your primary mind.

      </p>

      <p>Having a second mind is strenuous on your psyche, and your primary mind
      suffers a -2 manifester level penalty in any round in which the secondary
      mind has used its action. If your secondary mind does not do anything in a
      round, your primary mind does not suffer this penalty. Your second mind
      takes its first action on your turn in the round after schism is
      manifested.

      </p>

      <p>Both your minds communicate with each other telepathically. If you are
      subject to a compulsion or charm effect while you are of two minds, make a
      second saving throw if you fail the first. If you fail both, then the
      schism ends and you are affected normally by the power. If you fail just
      one, the schism ends immediately, but you are not subject to the
      compulsion or charm.

      </p>

      <p>Your second mind does not gain any advantages if you are subject to a
      haste effect, although you gain the overall standard benefits.

      </p>

      <p>Your second mind cannot access your psionic focus and does not benefit
      if you are maintaining psionic focus. Your second mind may gain psionic
      focus if you have the
