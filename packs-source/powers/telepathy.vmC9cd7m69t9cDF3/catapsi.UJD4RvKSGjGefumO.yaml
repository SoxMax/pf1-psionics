      <p>By manifesting this power, you generate psychic static, interfering
      with the ability of other psionic characters to manifest their powers or
      use psi-like abilities (you are not affected by your own catapsi
      manifestation). All psionic activity within the area requires 4 more power
      points to manifest than normal, unless a character makes a Will save each
      time he attempts to manifest a power. Using a psi-like ability becomes a
      full-round action, instead of a standard action, in a catapsi field. If
      two or more fields of catapsi overlap, the effects are not cumulative.

      </p>

      <p>The limit on the number of power points a subject can spend on a power
      remains in effect; thus, a subject may not be able to manifest its
      highest-level powers. If manifesting a power would cause the manifester to
      exceed his available power points or his spending limits, the
      manifestation fails automatically, but no power points are expended.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every 4 additional power points you
      spend, this power's range and the radius of its area both increase by 5
      feet.
