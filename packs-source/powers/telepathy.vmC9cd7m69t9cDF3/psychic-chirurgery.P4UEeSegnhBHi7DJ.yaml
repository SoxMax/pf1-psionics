      <p>You can repair psychic damage or grant another creature knowledge of
      powers you know, depending on the version of this power you manifest.

      </p><ul><li><em>Repair Psychic Damage:</em> You can remove any compulsions
      and charms affecting the subject. In fact, you can remove any
      instantaneous or permanent effect caused by a mindaffecting power or spell
      with psychic chirurgery. Unlike with aura alteration, these effects end or
      are negated as soon as this power is manifested, with no need for another
      saving throw.</li></ul>

      <ul><li>You can remove all negative levels (but see below) affecting the
      subject, regardless of how it received them, restoring it to the highest
      level it had previously attained. Permanent negative levels caused by
      energy drain or a similar effect, however, may only be cured if the effect
      occurred within a number of hours equal to your manifester
      level.</li></ul>

      <ul><li>You can also remove all psionic effects penalizing the subject's
      ability scores, heal all ability damage, and remove any ability drain
      affecting the subject. Psychic chirurgery negates all forms of insanity,
      confusion, the effect of such powers as microcosm, and so on, but it does
      not restore permanent negative levels due to death.</li></ul>

      <ul><li><em>Transfer Knowledge:</em> If desired, you can use this power to
      directly transfer knowledge of a power you know to another psionic
      character. You can give a character knowledge of a power of any level that
      she can manifest, even if the power is not normally on the character's
      power list, but a character is limited to gaining a number of powers equal
      to her key ability modifier. Knowledge of powers gained through psychic
      chirurgery does not count toward the maximum number of powers a character
      can know per level.</li></ul>

      <ul><li>Each time you use psychic chirurgery to implant knowledge of a
      power in another creature, you suffer ability burn to your key ability
      score equal to the level of the power implanted. If you and the subject
      are both willing to do so, you can split this damage evenly. You cannot
      manifest psychic chirurgery to bestow knowledge of a power if you are
      currently suffering ability burn to your key ability score, nor can
      psychic chirurgery be used to bestow knowledge of a power to a creature
      currently suffering from ability burn to their key ability
      score.</li></ul>
