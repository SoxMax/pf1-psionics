    value: >-
      <p>You tear the subconscious mind away from the target and send it into a
      personal nightmare, causing the target to be sickened unless it makes a
      successful Will save. At the beginning of each subsequent round, the
      target gets a Fortitude save to stop being sickened. While sickened, the
      target must make a concentration check (DC 20 + level of the power/spell
      they wish to manifest/cast) to manifest powers or cast spells, as their
      mind is in two places at once.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> You can augment this power in one or more of
      the following ways.

      </p><ol><li>If you spend 3 additional power points, the range increases to
      Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level).</li><li>If you spend 4 additional power
      points, the target becomes nauseated instead of sickened. On their first
      successful Fortitude save, they become sickened until they make another
      successful Fortitude save the following round(s).</li></ol>

      <p>In addition, for every 2 power points spent on the above augmentations,
      the save DC increases by 1.
