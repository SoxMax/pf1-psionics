    value: >-
      <p>You empathically share your pain and suffering with your attacker. Each
      time a creature strikes you in melee, it takes damage equal to one quarter
      the amount it dealt to you (rounded down, minimum 1) unless it succeeds on
      a Will save. This damage is empathic in nature, so powers and abilities
      the attacker may have such as damage reduction and regeneration do not
      lessen or change this damage. The damage from empathic feedback has no
      type, so even if you took fire damage from a creature that has immunity to
      fire, empathic feedback will damage your attacker. The damage from
      empathic feedback is a mind-affecting effect, a successful Will save
      negates this damage, and the damage is subject to power resistance.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> This power may be augmented in one of the
      following ways.

      </p><ol><li>By spending 3 additional power points, the damage suffered by
      your attacker increases to one half the damage dealt to you.</li><li>By
      spending 6 additional power points, the damage suffered by your attacker
      is equal to the damage dealt to you.</li></ol>
