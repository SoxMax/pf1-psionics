    value: >-
      <p>You join your mind with a creature and seize the afflictions around its
      mind, spreading them to others. When you manifest this power, choose a
      creature within range, then choose up to two additional creatures within
      range. The additional creatures must succeed at a Will save or immediately
      suffer the effects of all mind-affecting abilities affecting the first
      creature for 5 rounds, except that you are treated as the caster (or
      origin, as appropriate) for those effects.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> You may augment this power in one or both of
      the following ways.

      </p><ul><li>For every 4 additional power points you spend, the number of
      additional creatures increases by 2, to a maximum of 6.</li><li>If you
      spend 2 additional power points, make a manifester level check against DC
      11 + the caster or manifester level of the highest-level mind-affecting
      ability affecting the initial creature chosen. If you succeed, all
      mind-affecting abilities affecting that creature are removed.</li></ul>

      <p><strong>Surge Augmentation:</strong> If you invoke your wild surge
      while manifesting this power you shatter the spirit of its victims;
      creatures that fail their saves also suffer a penalty equal to your wild
      surge's intensity on attack rolls, skill checks, caster level checks, and
      manifester level checks for a number of rounds equal to your key ability
      modifier.
