      <p>By meditating on a subject, you can recall natural memories and
      knowledge otherwise inaccessible to you.

      </p>

      <p>On a failed Knowledge check, you can manifest this power to gain a new
      check with a +4 competence bonus. If successful, you instantly recall what
      was previously buried in your subconscious.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every 2 additional power points you
      spend, the competence bonus increases by +1.
