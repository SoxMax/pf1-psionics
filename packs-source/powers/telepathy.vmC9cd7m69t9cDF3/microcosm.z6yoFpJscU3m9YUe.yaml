      <p>This power enables you to warp the consciousness and senses of one or
      more creatures, sending the victim into a catatonic state. When microcosm
      is manifested, you can target either a single creature within range or a
      group of creatures all located within the power's area.

      </p><ul><li><em>Single Target:</em> If microcosm targets a single
      creature, that creature's senses are pinched off from the real world if it
      currently has 100 or fewer hit points. The subject's senses are all
      completely fabricated from within its own mind, though it may not realize
      this. In reality, the subject sprawls limply, drooling and mewling, and
      eventually dies of thirst and starvation without care. The subject lives
      within its own made-up world until the time of its actual death.</li></ul>

      <ul><li><em>Area Effect:</em> If microcosm is manifested on an area, it
      sends all affected creatures into a shared catatonia (the world is a
      construct, but within the world, the victims can interact with each
      other). It affects only creatures that currently have 30 or fewer hit
      points, and only up to a total of 300 hit points of such creatures. The
      power affects creatures with the lowest hit point totals first. (Creatures
      with negative hit points count as having 0 hit points.)</li></ul>

      <p>Manifesting microcosm a second time on an affected creature turns its
      sensory pathways outward once more. Otherwise, only very potent powers
      (such as psychic chirurgery or reality revision) or similar effects (such
      as miracle or wish) can undo the mental crosswiring that this power brings
      about.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every additional power point you spend,
      the number of hit points for a single target the power can affect
      increases by 10, and the number of hit points for an area effect increases
      by 30, and the maximum individual hit point of the creatures in the area
      affected increases by 3.

      </p>

      <p>If targeting a single creature, add ten times your tier to the maximum
      number of hit points that can be affected. If targeting an area, add twice
      your tier to the maximum number of hit points a particular creature can
      have to be affected, and ten times your tier to the total number of hit
      points of creatures that can be affected. This power bypasses non-mythic
      sources of power resistance, and you add your tier to checks to overcome
      mythic sources of power resistance.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augmented:</strong> If you expend two uses of mythic power, you
      can double the number of hit points used to determine creatures eligible
      to be affected.
