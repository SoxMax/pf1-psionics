      <p>This power can negate a barred mind, mind blank, or a personal barred
      mind affecting all creatures within range. If the affected creatures fail
      their saves and do not overcome your attempt with power resistance, you
      can shatter the effects by making a successful check (1d20 + your
      manifester level, maximum +20) against a DC equal to 11 + the manifester
      level of the creator of each of the effects. If you succeed, the barred
      mind or mind blank effect ends. Use the same check against each barred
      mind, mind blank, or personal barred mind effect.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> By spending an additional 4 power points, you
      may designate creatures within the affected area who are not affected by
      your manifestation of shatter mind blank.
