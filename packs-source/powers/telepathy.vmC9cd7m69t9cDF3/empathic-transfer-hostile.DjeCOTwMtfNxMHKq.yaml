    value: >-
      <p>You transfer your hurt to another. When you manifest this power and
      then make a successful touch attack, you can transfer 50 points of damage
      (or less, if you choose) from yourself to the touched creature. The damage
      you transfer may not exceed the damage you currently have. You immediately
      regain hit points equal to the amount of damage you transfer.

      </p>

      <p>You cannot use this power to gain hit points in excess of your full
      normal total. The transferred damage is empathic in nature, so powers and
      abilities the subject may have such as damage reduction and regeneration
      do not lessen or change this damage.

      </p>

      <p>The damage transferred by this power has no type, so even if the
      subject has immunity to the type of damage you originally took, the
      transfer occurs normally and deals hit point damage to the subject.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> You can augment this power in one or both of
      the following ways.

      </p><ol><li>For every additional power point you spend, you can transfer
      an additional 5 points of damage (maximum 70 points per manifestation),
      although you must still have that amount of actual damage to
      transfer.</li><li>If you spend 6 additional power points, this power
      affects all creatures in a 20-foot-radius spread centered on you,
      transferring the full amount of damage to each creature, although no
      matter how many targets you affect, you only heal the highest amount
      transferred to any one target.</li></ol>
