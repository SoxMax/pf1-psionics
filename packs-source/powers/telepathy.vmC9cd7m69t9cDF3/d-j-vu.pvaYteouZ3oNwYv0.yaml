      <p>Your mental impulse forces the subject to repeat the actions it took on
      its previous turn. If the situation has changed in such a way that the
      subject can't take the same actions again (if its foe is dead, or the
      subject has run out of power points, and so on), the subject stands still
      and takes no actions for 1 round. In any event, the subject can still
      defend itself, and it retains its Dexterity bonus to AC even if it stands
      still.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every 2 additional power points you
      spend, this power's save DC increases by 1.
