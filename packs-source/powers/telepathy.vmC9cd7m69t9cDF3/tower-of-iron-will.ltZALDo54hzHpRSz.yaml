      <p>You generate a bastion of thought so strong that it offers protection
      to you and everyone around you, improving the self-control of all. You and
      all allies in the power's area gain power resistance 19 against all
      mind-affecting powers.

      </p>

      <p>You can manifest this power instantly, quickly enough to gain its
      benefits in an emergency. Manifesting the power is an immediate action.

      </p>

      <p>You can use this power even when it is not your turn.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every additional power point you spend,
      this power's duration increases by 1 round and the power resistance it
      provides increases by 1 point.
