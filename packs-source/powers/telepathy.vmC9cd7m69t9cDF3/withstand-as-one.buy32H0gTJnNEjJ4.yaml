      <p>When manifesting this power, you must choose one kind of saving throw:
      Fortitude, Reflex, or Will. For the duration of the power, all willing
      targets share the highest base bonus to that save. This only includes
      bonus to saves from hit dice (including racial hit dice and class levels),
      not any bonuses from ability scores, racial traits, class features,
      temporary effects such as powers, spells, and items, or such. You and all
      willing targets may use the highest save between you in place of their
      original values.

      </p>

      <p>Alternatively, you may force all targets to use the lowest save bonus
      between you in place of their original base save. If this decreases the
      target's bonus, then the target may attempt a Will save (with his normal
      Will saving throw modifier) every round to ignore the effects of this
      power for that round.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> You can augment this power in one or more of
      the following ways.

      </p><ol><li>If you spend 2 additional power points, you may choose a
      second kind of saving throw to share. If you spend 6 additional power
      points, you may choose to share all three kinds of saves with all targets.
      Compare each new save individually with each target's original, and use
      the favorable choice for the version of the power you are
      using.</li><li>For every 4 additional power points you spend, you may also
      select one class feature belonging to you or a target that directly
      modifies the saving throw(s) you share, either by providing a bonus or by
      altering the effects of successful and/or failed saves. Example class
      features include evasion and improved evasion, still mind, divine grace,
      and slippery mind. The GM may allow additional abilities at his
      discretion. You may effectively grant this class feature to any or all
      willing targets of your choice; treat them as if they actually had the
      class feature in question, with one exception: if a class feature has
      additional benefits besides directly modifying the saving throw (such as
      fear immunity from Aura of Courage), then they are not included.</li></ol>

      <p>In addition, for every 2 power points spent to achieve either of these
      effects, the save DC increases by 1.
