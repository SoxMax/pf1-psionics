      <p>Your next single melee attack is imbued to distract the opponent. If
      the attack is successful, you deal damage normally and, until the end of
      its next turn, your target takes a -2 penalty to attack rolls and can't
      make attacks of opportunity. If your attack misses, the target instead
      takes a -1 penalty to attack rolls until the end of its next turn, but can
      make attacks of opportunity as normal. Any power resistance your target
      has is applicable against this effect.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> You can augment this power in one or both of
      the following ways.

      </p><ol><li>For every four additional power points spent, this power
      affects one additional melee attack during this round. Effects from
      multiple attacks do not stack.</li><li>If you spend 6 additional power
      points, you can instead manifest this power upon making a successful melee
      attack and have the effects of this power instead apply to that attack.
      Doing so still uses your swift action for the round.</li></ol>
