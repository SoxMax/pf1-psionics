    value: >-
      <p>You emit an aura that causes creatures to be uninterested in you or
      those accompanying you. The affected creatures are aware of your presence,
      but simply find your presence unworthy of their attention. Creatures
      accompanying you must be within 10 feet of you to be similarly ignored.
      Any action that would directly harm the affected creature allows it to
      make an additional save against this power with a +4 circumstance bonus to
      negate this effect.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> If you spend an additional 4 power points,
      the duration becomes 10 minutes/level.
