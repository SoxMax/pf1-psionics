      <p>You reach into the subject's mind and modify as many as 5 minutes of
      its memories in one of the following ways.

      </p>

      <p>Eliminate all memory of an event the subject actually experienced. This
      cannot negate charm, geas/quest, suggestion, or similar spells.

      </p>

      <p>Allow the subject to recall with perfect clarity an event it actually
      experienced.

      </p>

      <p>Change the details remembered of an event the subject actually
      experienced.

      </p>

      <p>Implant a memory of an event the subject never experienced.

      </p>

      <p>Manifesting this power takes 1 round. If the subject fails to save, you
      proceed by spending as much as 5 minutes (a period of time equal to the
      amount of memory you want to modify) visualizing the memory you wish to
      modify in the subject. If your concentration is disturbed before the
      visualization is complete, or if the subject is ever beyond the power's
      range during this time, the power fails.

      </p>

      <p>A modified memory does not necessarily affect the subject's actions,
      particularly if it contradicts the creature's natural inclinations. An
      illogical modified memory is dismissed by the creature as a bad dream, too
      much wine, or another similar excuse.
