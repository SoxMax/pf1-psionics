      <p>You link the minds of your allies, dramatically improving their
      coordination. When you manifest this power, a type of heads-up display
      appears in each target's mind, improving their coordination and group
      awareness. Each affected target can use the Aid Another action as an
      immediate action. Creatures that move out of the 30 foot range after the
      power is manifested are still affected by the power.

      </p>

      <p>Additionally, all targets that are also willing members of your
      collective (if any) gain one special ability of your choice from this
      list. Your choice affects all members equally.

      </p><ul><li>+1 circumstance bonus to attack rolls</li><li>+1 circumstance
      bonus to AC</li><li>+2 circumstance bonus to weapon damage</li><li>+5
      circumstance bonus to speed</li></ul>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> You may augment this power in one or both of
      the following ways.

      </p><ol><li>If you spend 2 additional power points, you can choose a
      second special ability from the collective bonus list. You may choose the
      same benefit again; if you do, it stacks with itself (up to +5 for attack
      rolls or AC, +10 for weapon damage, or +25 for bonus to speed).</li><li>If
      you spend 2 additional power points, you can use this power as if you had
      the collective class feature, treating creatures with which you have
      established a mental link, such as the mindlink power, as members.
      Creatures that would not consider you an ally if not for the link do not
      count as willing members.</li></ol>
