      <p>You send a powerful morale boost to the targets, a telepathic
      equivalent of an epic battle speech, preparing them to overcome a
      difficult challenge. Each affected creature gains a +5 morale bonus to
      attack rolls, Armor Class, and saving throws, as well as 50 temporary hit
      points.

      </p>

      <p>In addition, each affected creature gains immunity to fear effects for
      the duration of the power and if brought below 0 hit points but not
      killed, the target can fight on for one more round as if disabled. At the
      end of his next turn, unless brought to above 0 hit points, the affected
      creature immediately falls unconscious and begins dying.
