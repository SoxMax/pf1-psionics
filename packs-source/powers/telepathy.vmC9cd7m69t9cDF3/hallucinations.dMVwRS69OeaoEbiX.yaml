      <p>You cause the targets to believe they hear any sound you imagine.

      </p>

      <p>The sound can include intelligible speech. Instead of precisely
      imagining a sound, you can identify a sound the subjects know and they
      imagine it doing what you describe as you manifest the power. All targets
      hear the same sounds. You can change the sound as part of concentrating on
      the power.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> This power can be augmented in any of the
      following ways:

      </p><ol><li>If you spend 2 additional power points, you can script
      whatever happens for 1 minute per level, instead of having to concentrate
      on the power. The power will play out as you defined it, including
      reacting to what the targets say or do, provided you defined that
      interaction when scripting it.</li><li>If you spend 4 additional power
      points, you can include the image of any object, creature, or force you
      imagine or identify for the targets to imagine. You can move the image
      while you concentrate. The image fails and disappears when struck by an
      opponent unless you cause it to react appropriately while concentrating.
      Its AC is equal to 10 + 1/2 your manifester level.</li><li>If you spend 6
      additional power points, you can include an image as above, but also any
      olfactory, thermal and tactile elements, completing the mental
      hallucination.</li><li>If you spend 5 additional power points, you can
      create a triggered mindtrick instead. This changes the duration to 1
      week/level + 1 minute/level. You set the triggering condition (such as
      hearing a certain word or seeing a type of creature) when manifesting the
      power. The event that triggers the power can be as general or detailed as
      desired but must be based on an audible, tactile, olfactory, or visual
      trigger. The trigger can't be based on any quality not normally obvious to
      the senses, such as alignment. This power uses the target's senses to
      notice triggers. If this event happens during the first duration, the
      mindtrick plays out as if you had scripted it, for 1 minute per level and
      then ends.</li><li>If you spend 8 additional power points, change the
      target to 1 target and the duration to permanent. You can make a general
      script for how the power interacts, when it activates and other general
      reactions, and the targets mind will actively work to make these scripts
      work.</li></ol>
