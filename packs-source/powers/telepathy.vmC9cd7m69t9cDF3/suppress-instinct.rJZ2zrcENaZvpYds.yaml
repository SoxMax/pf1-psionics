  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Your thoughts gently caress the primitive mind of an animal, reworking
      its most base urges to enable it to act more calmly than natural. Once
      under the effect of this power, the subject animal becomes temporarily
      immune to fear effects. In addition, the animal can now potentially be
      convinced to perform acts that it would otherwise be unwilling to do, such
      as run through a sheet of fire or walk along a sharp cliff. This may allow
      an animal to take advantage of abilities that would normally alarm it,
      such as if it were subject to a <em>fly </em>spell (though directing it in
      flight may require Handle Animal checks).

      </p>

      <p>This does not make an animal suicidal, but merely keeps its natural
      fears from preventing it from acting. You also do not gain any special
      influence over the animal and must direct it as you would to take any
      actions it would not normally find distasteful.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment: </strong>For every two additional power points you
      spend, you may manifest this power on one additional animal. You do not
      need to touch each animal at the same time to activate this power but must
      touch all target animals within the duration of the power.
