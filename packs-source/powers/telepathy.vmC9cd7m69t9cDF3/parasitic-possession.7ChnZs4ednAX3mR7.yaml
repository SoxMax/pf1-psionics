    value: >-
      <p>You transform into telepathic energy patterns and infect a living
      creature. While inside, you do not need to sleep, eat, or breathe and
      experience everything the target experiences, but you are unable to take
      any actions aside from dismissing the power. The target creature is
      unaware that you are within it unless it made a successful Spellcraft
      check to identify the power when you manifested it. When the power ends or
      is dismissed, you materialize at a location of your choosing within 30 ft.
      of the target.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> If you spend 6 additional power points, the
      subject is under your control as if under the effect of mind control.
