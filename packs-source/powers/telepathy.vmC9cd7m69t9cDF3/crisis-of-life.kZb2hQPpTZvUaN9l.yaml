      <p>You interrupt the subject's autonomic heart rhythm, killing it
      instantly on a failed saving throw if it has 11 Hit Dice or less. If the
      target makes its saving throw or has more than 11 Hit Dice, it takes 7d6
      points of damage.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every additional power point you spend,
      this power can kill a subject that has Hit Dice equal to 11 + the number
      of additional points. For every two additional points spent, the power's
      save DC increases by 1.
