      <p>The subject's higher mind is locked away. He stands dazed, unable to
      take any actions other than those identified below.

      </p>

      <p>A brain locked subject is not stunned, so attackers get no special
      advantage against him.

      </p>

      <p>A brain locked flyer must descend to the closest safe level area below
      it. An air-breathing swimmer must make for the surface.

      </p>

      <p>Each round on its turn, the subject may attempt a new saving throw to
      end the effect. This is a full-round action that does not provoke attacks
      of opportunity.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> You can augment this power in one or both of
      the following ways.

      </p><ol><li>If you spend 2 additional power points, this power can also
      affect an animal, fey, magical beast, or monstrous humanoid.</li><li>If
      you spend 4 additional power points, this power can also affect an
      aberration, dragon, elemental, or outsider in addition to the creature
      types mentioned above.</li></ol>

      <p>In addition, for every 2 power points spent on either of the above
      options, the power's save DC is increased by 1.
