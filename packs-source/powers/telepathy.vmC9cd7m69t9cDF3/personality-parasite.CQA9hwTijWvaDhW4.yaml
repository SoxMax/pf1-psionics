      <p>You attempt to briefly partition the mind of your foe, calving off a
      minor personality that is antagonistic to the main personality. The
      parasitic personality functions with complete autonomy from the main
      personality. It does not control the body physically, but it can take one
      standard action each round that is purely mental, such as manifesting a
      power, in the same turn that the subject takes its normal actions.

      </p>

      <p>The parasitic personality manifests powers using the subject's power
      point reserve and known powers, or any spells prepared or known and
      available spell slots, but can only manifest powers or cast spells three
      or more levels lower than the highest level of power or spell the subject
      can normally manifest or cast.

      </p>

      <p>The parasitic personality actively attempts to manifest powers or cast
      spells that negatively impact the subject, using the highest-level powers
      or spells possible (so as to deplete the subject's power point reserve and
      available spell slots), and the most deadly to the subject. You do not
      have control over what the parasitic personality does, though it always
      works against the interest of the subject.

      </p>

      <p>Both minds communicate with each other telepathically. If a creature is
      targeted by a compulsion or charm effect while under the effect of this
      power, it can make a second saving throw if the first one fails. If both
      saving throws fail, then this power ends and the creature is affected by
      the charm or compulsion effect.

      </p>

      <p>The parasitic personality does not gain any advantages if the main
      personality is subjected to a haste or schism effect.
