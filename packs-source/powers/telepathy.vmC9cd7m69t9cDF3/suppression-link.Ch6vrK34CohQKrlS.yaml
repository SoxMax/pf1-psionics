      <p>You must be a <a href="/wiki/Highlord" title="Highlord">Highlord</a>
      following the <a href="/wiki/Despot_(Tenets_of_Oppression)" title="Despot
      (Tenets of Oppression)">Despot (Tenets of Oppression)</a> to manifest this
      power. You cannot learn this power with the <a
      href="/wiki/Expanded_Knowledge" title="Expanded Knowledge">Expanded
      Knowledge</a> feat or similar abilities.

      </p>

      <p>You establish a short-lived telepathic bond with a creature within
      range, concentrating on shutting of the creature’s ability to act against
      you or escape from you. You can manifest this power as either a standard
      action or a move action; if you manifest it as a move action,
      concentrating on it is likewise a move action.

      </p><ul><li><strong>Standard Action: </strong>The target must succeed at a
      Will save or become entangled as long as you concentrate + 1 round
      thereafter. On a successful save, they become entangled for 1 round
      instead.</li><li><strong>Move Action: </strong>The target must succeed at
      a Will save or become entangled as long as you concentrate.</li></ul>

      <p>Creatures entangled by this power cannot willingly move in directions
      that would increase the distance between them and your location (including
      using abilities that would increase the distance between you and them,
      such as teleportation). Each turn you maintain this power, you can choose
      to drag creatures entangled by the power up to 10 feet (or 5 feet, if you
      are maintaining it as a move action) towards you.

      </p>

      <p>You can drag entangled creatures when you move, by halving the distance
      you would normally move (to a minimum of 5 feet, even if halving it would
      result in a lower distance). You must still follow all the restrictions of
      your movement (such as where you can move, or where you must end your
      movement).

      </p>

      <p>In both cases, if you would drag them into a space they cannot enter
      (such as a wall or that of another creature), you must either end this
      power’s effect on them, change direction, or stop moving. Otherwise, you
      can freely drag them along with you.

      </p>

      <p>The movement of dragged creatures does not provoke attacks of
      opportunity, and your movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity
      from creatures you’re dragging. If you would drag a creature into a space
      that can’t support them or a hazardous location (such as the air for a
      nonflying creature or a pit of lava), they may make another saving throw
      against the power. If they succeed, they are not dragged, end the effects
      of the power upon them, and fall prone in their space.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment: </strong>This power can be augmented in one or more of
      the following ways. Every 2 power points you spend augmenting this power
      adds +1 to the power’s save DC (if any). This is in addition to the
      effects of the augments themselves.

      </p><ol><li>For every additional power point you spend, you gain a +1
      bonus on concentration checks made for this power, except to manifest it
      defensively.</li><li>If you spend 2 additional power points, the target
      becomes staggered for the duration of the power.</li><li>For every 3
      additional power points you spend, you can drag creatures 10 additional
      feet (or 5 feet, if you are maintaining the power as a move action) each
      turn you maintain this power.</li><li>If you spend 4 additional power
      points, the target becomes dazed (standard action manifestation) or
      nauseated (move action manifestation) for 1 round on a failed saving
      throw.</li><li>If you spend 6 additional power points, the target becomes
      blinded for the duration of the power (if the power ends or has its
      duration reduced thanks to a successful save, so does the
      blind).</li><li>If you spend 6 additional power points, if you would have
      used a standard action to manifest and maintain the power, you can instead
      do so as a move action. If you would have used a move action to manifest
      and maintain the power, you can instead do so as a swift action.</li></ol>
