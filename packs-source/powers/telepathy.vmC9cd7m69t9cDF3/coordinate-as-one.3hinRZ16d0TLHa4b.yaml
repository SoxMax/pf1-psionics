    value: >-
      <p>You form a mental bond with one creature within range, giving them the
      ability to 'borrow' your perception and use that information to direct
      their movements.

      </p>

      <p>You may choose to direct the target either offensively, alerting them
      to weaknesses in their opponent's defenses, or defensively, alerting them
      to incoming attacks. You may change whether you are directing offensively
      or defensively once per round as a free action. While being directed
      offensively, the subject gains a +1 insight bonus on attack rolls and
      damage rolls. While being directed defensively, the subject receives a +1
      insight bonus on armor class and saving throws.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> This power may be augmented in one or both of
      the following ways.

      </p><ol><li>For every 3 additional power points you spend, increase the
      insight bonus by 1.</li><li>If you spend 6 additional power points, the
      target can be directed both offensively and defensively.</li></ol>
