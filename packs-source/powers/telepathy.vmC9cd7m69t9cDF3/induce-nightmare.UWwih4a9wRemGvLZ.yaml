      <p>You send a hideous and unsettling phantasmal vision to a specific
      creature that you name or otherwise specifically designate.

      </p>

      <p>The nightmare prevents restful sleep and causes 1d10 points of damage.
      The nightmare leaves the subject fatigued and unable to regain power
      points and arcane spells for the next 24 hours.

      </p>

      <p>The difficulty of the save depends on your knowledge the subject and
      the physical connection (if any) you have to that creature.

      <p>*You must have some sort of connection to a creature of which you have
      no knowledge.

      </p>

      <p>Dispel evil cast on the subject while you are manifesting the power
      dispels the nightmare and causes you to be stunned for 10 minutes per
      caster level of the dispel evil.

      </p>

      <p>If the recipient is awake when the power begins, you can choose to
      cease manifesting (ending the power) or to enter a trance until the
      recipient goes to sleep, whereupon you become alert again and complete the
      casting. If you are disturbed during the trance, you must succeed on a
      Concentration check as if you were in the midst of manifesting a power or
      the power ends.

      </p>

      <p>If you choose to enter a trance, you are not aware of your surroundings
      or the activities around you while in the trance.

      </p>

      <p>You are defenseless, both physically and mentally, while in the trance.
      (You always fail Reflex and Will saving throws, for example.)

      </p>

      <p>Creatures who don't sleep (such as elves, but not halfelves) or dream
      are immune to this effect.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every 2 additional power points spent,
      this power causes an additional 1d10 points of damage when the sleeper
      wakes.
