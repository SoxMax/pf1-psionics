      <p>You distort the way others perceive and remember you, making it hard
      for creatures to recall knowledge of you and your kind. Creatures
      attempting Knowledge checks to identify you and your traits (such as
      abilities or weaknesses) suffer a -4 penalty to do so. This does not
      affect Knowledge checks made to research you or information related to you
      (such as at a public library) or other forms of information-gathering
      related to you (such as Sense Motive or Diplomacy checks). Creatures that
      fail Knowledge checks to identify you and your traits learn false
      information instead of learning nothing.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> You may augment this power in the following
      ways:

      </p><ol><li>For every additional power point you spend, the penalty to
      Knowledge checks increases by 2.</li><li>If you spend 2 additional power
      points, you may determine the form of misinformation learned by creatures
      failing their Knowledge checks.</li></ol>
