      <p>A light nausea overtakes you as you witness violation of your body, and
      a solid object slides under your skin. When you manifest this power, you
      must be holding a psionic dorje that contains a power that is on your
      power list but is not necessarily one of your powers known. That dorje
      merges into your flesh, becoming part of your body.</p><p>As long as the
      dorje you have absorbed has charges, you may manifest its contained power
      as if it was one of your powers known. You must expend power points as
      normal to manifest the absorbed power as well as one charge from the
      dorje. The manifested power uses your manifester level and ability score
      for purposes of determining its DC and other variable effects.</p><p>Once
      the absorbed dorje runs out of charges, it is immediately ejected from
      your body. You cannot eject it earlier voluntarily however a day after you
      absorb the dorje, it will slide harmlessly from your skin as <em>absorb
      dorje </em>expires. You can never have more than one dorje absorbed;
      attempting to manifest this power again while it is already in effect does
      not work.</p>
