      <p>If you have a claw attack (either from an actual natural weapon or from
      an effect such as claws of the beast), you can use this power to improve
      that weapon. One of your claws becomes two-dimensional, making it
      razor-sharp. The weapon is now psionically keen, increasing its threat
      range from 20 to 19–20. This benefit does not stack with other effects
      that improve a weapon's threat range.
