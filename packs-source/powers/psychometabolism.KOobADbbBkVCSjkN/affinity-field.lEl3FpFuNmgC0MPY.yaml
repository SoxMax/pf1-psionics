      <p>You create an affinity feedback loop with all creatures within the
      area. While the duration lasts, affected creatures take all damage
      (including ability damage) as you do and heal all wounds as you do. Hit
      points gained or lost persist after this power ends.

      </p>

      <p>Creatures in range are also subject to magical and psionic effects of
      3rd level or lower. Creatures that have an affinity to you gain a saving
      throw against each new power transferred through the affinity field as if
      the power were manifested upon them normally. All magical and psionic
      effects transferred to subjects fade at the end of this power's duration,
      although instantaneous effects remain. If you suddenly become immune to a
      particular effect or power, the effect or power to which you are immune
      cannot be transferred to creatures that have affinity to you, although
      effects already on creatures that have affinity to you are not ended
      unless that creature also gains the same immunity.
