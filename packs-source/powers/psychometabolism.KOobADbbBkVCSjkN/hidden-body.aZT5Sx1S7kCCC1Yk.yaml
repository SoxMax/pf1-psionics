      <p>You meld into the touched creature, psionically fusing with their form.
      At the time of manifesting, it is decided if you or the creature touched
      are the host and the other is the passenger. While fused, the passenger is
      dormant and unaware. Any other effects that were on the passenger do not
      affect the host, and vice versa, while the power is in effect. The
      passenger does not need to eat, drink, or sleep, has no concept of time,
      and is not aware of surroundings or anything that occurs to the host. The
      host can discharge the passenger as a standard action that does not
      provoke attacks of opportunity. If the host is killed or the power ends,
      the passenger is immediately discharged adjacent to the host (or the
      host's last location for effects such as disintegration). You cannot be
      under the effect of hidden body and fusion at the same time.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> This power can be augmented in one of the
      following ways.

      </p><ol><li>If you spend 4 additional power points, the passenger is aware
      of everything the host is aware of, although the passenger can still take
      no actions while fused.</li><li>If you spend 8 additional power points,
      the passenger is aware of everything the host is aware of and can take
      purely mental actions such as manifesting powers, although the passenger
      is restricted to the senses of the host unless using some other means of
      senses. The power's duration changes to 1 round / level (D).</li></ol>
