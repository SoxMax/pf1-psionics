      <p>You move and act more quickly than normal. This extra speed has several
      effects.

      </p>

      <p>When making a full attack action, you gain one additional attack. The
      attack is made using your full base attack bonus, plus any modifiers
      appropriate to the situation. (This effect is not cumulative with similar
      effects, such as that provided by a speed weapon, nor does it actually
      grant an extra action, so you can't use it to manifest a second power or
      otherwise take an extra action in the round.)

      </p>

      <p>You gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls and a +1 dodge bonus to AC and
      Reflex saves. Any condition that makes you lose your Dexterity bonus to
      Armor Class (if any) also makes you lose dodge bonuses.

      </p>

      <p>All of your modes of movement (including land movement, burrow, climb,
      fly, and swim) increase by 30 feet, to a maximum of twice your normal
      speed using that form of movement. This increase counts as an enhancement
      bonus, and it affects your jumping distance as normal for increased speed.
      Multiple physical acceleration effects don't stack, nor does it stack with
      haste. Physical acceleration negates slow.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> If you spend an additional 6 power points,
      you can manifest this power as a swift action.
