  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You can absorb one weapon of up to 15 lbs into your body and a small
      tattoo that resembles the item absorbed appears on the skin of your arm.
      The absorbed item is undetectable by normal means, although the effect is
      detectable via detect psionics. The item can be discharged as a standard
      action and the weapon is automatically equipped. You must be capable of
      holding the weapon or it falls to your feet (such as if you had no hands
      free). If the effect ends without being discharged, the item falls to your
      feet.

      </p>

      <p>The weight of the item still counts toward your encumbrance even when
      absorbed.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> This power can be augmented in one or more of
      the following ways.

      </p><ol><li>For every additional power point spent the weight limit of the
      item to be absorbed increases by 5 lbs.</li><li>If you spend two
      additional power points, you can absorb a shield or armor instead of a
      weapon. You do not suffer any applicable armor check penalty of the shield
      or armor absorbed and when discharged, you automatically equip the shield
      or armor as long as you are capable of equipping the item.</li><li>If you
      spend two additional power points, you can store one additional item,
      although all stored items are discharged at the same time and are added
      together when determining the total weight.</li></ol>
