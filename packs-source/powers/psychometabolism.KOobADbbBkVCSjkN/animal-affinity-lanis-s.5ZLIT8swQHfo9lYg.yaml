      <p>You forge a psychometabolic affinity with an idealized animal form,
      thereby boosting one of your ability scores (choose Strength, Dexterity,
      Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma). The power grants a +4
      enhancement bonus to the ability score you choose, adding the usual
      benefits provided by a high ability bonus. Because you are emulating the
      idealized form of an animal, you also take on minor aspects of the animal
      you choose. If you choose to increase the ability you use to manifest
      powers, you do not gain the benefit of an increased ability score long
      enough to gain any bonus power points for a high ability score, but the
      save DCs of your powers increase for the duration of this power.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every 5 additional power points you
      spend, this power grants a +4 enhancement bonus to another ability score.
