      <p>You gain the ability to siphon away your enemy's strength for your own
      use. One of your natural or manufactured weapons becomes the instrument of
      your desire, and deals 1 point of Strength damage on each successful hit.
      You gain that point of Strength as an enhancement bonus to your Strength
      score. Strength you siphon from different foes is tracked separately—the
      total siphoned from each individual foe is considered a separate
      enhancement bonus to your Strength (maximum +8), and you gain only the
      highest total.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> You can augment this power in one or both of
      the following ways.

      </p><ol><li>For every 3 additional power points you spend, the maximum
      enhancement bonus you can add to your Strength increases by 2.</li><li>If
      you spend 6 additional power points, you can manifest this power as a
      swift action.</li></ol>
