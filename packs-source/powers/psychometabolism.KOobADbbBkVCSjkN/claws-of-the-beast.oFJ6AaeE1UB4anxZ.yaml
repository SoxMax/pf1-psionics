    value: >-
      <p>You call forth the aggressive nature of the beast inherent in yourself,
      psionically transforming your hands into deadly claws. You gain two
      natural attacks with your claws, each dealing 1d4 points of damage (1d6 if
      you are Large, or 1d3 if you are Small or smaller) plus your Strength
      bonus. If you are Huge or larger (or would have claws effectively that
      size, due to Improved Natural Attack or similar effects), your damage
      improves one step per size increase on the following scale: 1d3, 1d4, 1d6,
      1d8, 2d6, 3d6 (+1d6 per additional step beyond 3d6).

      </p>

      <p>Your claws are natural weapons, so you are considered armed when
      attacking with them, and they can be affected by powers, spells, and
      effects that enhance or improve natural weapons. You can choose to deal
      nonlethal damage with your claws, taking the standard –4 penalty on your
      attack roll.

      </p>

      <p>Your claws work just like the natural weapons of many monsters. You can
      make an attack with one claw or a full attack with two claws at your
      normal attack bonus, replacing your normal attack routine. You take no
      penalties for twoweapon fighting, and neither attack is a secondary attack
      unless you are using manufactured weapons in the same round, in which case
      any claw not used to wield a weapon is considered a secondary attack (just
      like any other creature which uses both manufactured and natural weapons).
      If your base attack bonus is +6 or higher, you do not gain any additional
      attacks—you simply have two claw attacks at your normal attack bonus. You
      may use secondary natural attacks as normal when using your claw attacks
      as part of a full attack.

      </p>

      <p>You can call or dismiss the claws as a swift action during the duration
      of the power. If you attack with a manufactured weapon or another primary
      natural attack, you can't make any claw attacks in that round. You can
      still hold and manipulate items with your claws or cast spells just as
      well as you could with your hands.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> This power may be augmented in one of the
      following ways.

      </p><ol><li>If you spend 2 additional power points, your damage improves
      one step on the above scale.</li><li>If you spend 4 additional power
      points, your damage improves two steps on the above scale.</li><li>If you
      spend 6 additional power points, your damage improves three steps on the
      above scale.</li><li>If you spend 10 or more additional power points, your
      damage improves three steps on the above scale, plus an additional step
      for every 4 power points spent on augmentation beyond 6 (four steps at +10
      power points, five steps at +14 power points, etc.).</li></ol>
