      <p>The glands of your body emit massive quantities of endorphins,
      augmenting your natural abilities. While this power is active, you are
      treated as if in a barbarian rage, giving you a +2 morale bonus to your
      Constitution and Strength, a +1 morale bonus on Will saves, and a -2
      penalty to your Armor Class. The effect is otherwise identical with a
      barbarian's rage except you aren't fatigued at the end of the rage.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> If you spend 6 additional power points, the
      morale bonus to your Constitution and Strength is increased by 2, and the
      morale bonus on Will saves is increased by 1.
