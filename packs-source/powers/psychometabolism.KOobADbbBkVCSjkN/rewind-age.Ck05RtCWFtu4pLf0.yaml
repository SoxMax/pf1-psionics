      <p>You ignore the physical detriments of being middle-aged. This spell
      does not cause you to look younger, nor does it prevent you from dying of
      old age, but as long as the spell is in effect, you ignore the –1
      penalties to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution that accrue once you
      become middle-aged. You retain the age-related bonuses to Intelligence,
      Wisdom, and Charisma while under the effects of this spell. Additional
      penalties that you accrue upon becoming old or venerable apply in full.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment: </strong>This power may be augmented in one or more of
      the following ways.

      </p><ol><li>For every 3 power points you spend, you ignore the penalties
      of another, higher, age category (old, venerable).</li><li>If you spend 3
      additional power points, the duration becomes 1 day/level.</li><li>If you
      spend 2 additional power points, the range becomes Touch and the target
      becomes: One living creature.</li></ol>
