      <p>You heal another creature's wounds, transferring some of its damage to
      yourself. When you manifest this power, you can heal as much as 2d10
      points of damage. The target regains a number of hit points equal to the
      dice result, and you lose hit points equal to half of that amount. (This
      loss can bring you to 0 or fewer hit points.) Powers and abilities you may
      have such as damage reduction and regeneration do not lessen or change
      this damage, since you are taking the target's pain into yourself in an
      empathic manner. The damage transferred by this power has no type, so even
      if you have immunity to the type of damage the target originally took, the
      transfer occurs normally and deals hit point damage to you.

      </p>

      <p>Alternatively, you can use this power to absorb one poison or one
      disease afflicting the target creature into yourself. When you absorb a
      poison or disease, you do not take any of the damage previously dealt to
      the target by the affliction, but you do assume the burden of making the
      secondary and/or continuing Fortitude saves to combat the affliction.

      </p>

      <p>Finally, you can use this power to transfer up to 1 point of ability
      damage per manifester level from the target to yourself.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every additional power point you spend,
      you can heal an additional 2d10 points of damage (to a maximum of 10d10
      points per manifestation).
