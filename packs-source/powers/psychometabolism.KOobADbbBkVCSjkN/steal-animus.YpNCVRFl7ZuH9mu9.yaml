    value: >-
      <p>Manifesting this power allows the manifester to steal the unstable
      animus from a target with a touch. The manifester makes a touch attack
      against the target and may attempt to steal 1d4 points of animus from the
      target. A successful Will save by the target halves the loss of animus. If
      the target does not possess animus, this power has no effect.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment: </strong>If you spend an additional 2 power points
      points, you may alter the range of this power to close range (25 feet + 5
      feet per two manifester levels) and make the attack as a ranged touch
      attack.

      </p>

      <p>For every additional 2 power points spent, you may steal an additional
      1d4 points of animus from the target.
