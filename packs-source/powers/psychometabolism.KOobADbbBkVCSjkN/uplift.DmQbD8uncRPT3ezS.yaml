      <p>A sphere of psychic static emanates from you, hinting at a furious
      transmission of mental identity. By manifesting this power, you attempt to
      raise the Intelligence of the target animal by gifting some of your own.
      When you use <em>uplift</em>, your Intelligence score is reduced as if by
      ability score damage by an amount you select. This reduction cannot be
      healed, repaired, or negated in any way until <em>uplift </em>ends, at
      which point your Intelligence score returns to its normal level (applying
      any actual damage or drain you might have). You cannot reduce your
      Intelligence score below 1 using this power.

      </p>

      <p>At the same time that your intellect is reduced, the mental capacity of
      the target creature is increased by the same amount. The cogitation thus
      granted is your own and some of your knowledge is gifted along with it. A
      target subject to <em>uplift </em>learns Common or one other language you
      know (though they may not have the physical ability to speak it).

      </p>

      <p>This power does not place the target animal under your control or
      influence it in any way, but it may provide the creature sufficient
      intelligence that it can be bargained with, or convinced to provide
      assistance by reasoned use of Diplomacy. Perversely, as the mental
      capacity of the target animal increases, yours reduces, potentially
      rendering you unable to effectively reason with it.

      </p>

      <p>The target creature type for <em>uplift </em>cannot be altered by any
      other spell, power, feat, class feature or other ability.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment: </strong>This power may be augmented in one or more of
      the following ways:

      </p><ul><li>For every additional power point you spend, you may transfer
      all of your ranks in one skill you possess to the target creature. Using
      this augment temporarily removes your access to those ranks until the
      power ends.</li><li>For every two additional power points you spend, the
      DC of this power increases by one.</li></ul>
