      <p>This power shrouds your hand or a natural weapon you possess with
      darkness that you can use to drain an opponent's power.

      </p>

      <p>If you manifest this power to affect your hand, the next successful
      melee touch attack you make (if the victim fails its Fortitude save)
      drains 2 power points from your foe for every manifester level you have.
      The drained points simply dissipate. Your touch attack, charged with
      psionic power, is treated as an armed attack.

      </p>

      <p>If you manifest this power to affect a natural weapon you possess, you
      must make a successful melee attack with the weapon to gain the power's
      benefit.

      </p>

      <p>Against a psionic being that has no power points or a nonpsionic foe,
      your attack instead deals 2 points of Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma
      damage (your choice).
