      <p>With a sudden disturbing throb, your foes ears become exceptionally
      tuned, their drums refusing to vibrate in response to carefully chosen
      stimuli. When you manifest this power on a creature that can hear
      normally, you specify one other creature that it will become unable to
      hear any longer. Once in place, <em>selective hearing </em>prevents its
      target from being able to hear the voice of the source creature you have
      chosen. The source creature does not need to be within range of this power
      when you manifest it, however you must have heard the source creature’s
      voice in the past.

      </p>

      <p>The target creature can still hear other sounds created by the source
      creature, allowing for simple communication through such means as banging
      two items together.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment: </strong>You can augment this power in one or both of
      the following ways:

      </p><ul><li>For every additional three power points you spend, you can
      choose a second target creature or a second source creature. For instance,
      this could allow you to have one creature that cannot hear two others, or
      to have two creatures that cannot hear a single common other. You can
      augment in both ways at once by spending appropriate power
      points.</li><li>By spending an additional six power points, all sounds
      created by the source creature are inaudible to your target.</li></ul>

      <p>For every two additional power points spent on either augment, the DC
      of this power increases by 1.

      </p>

      <p><em><strong>Mythic Selective Hearing</strong></em></p>

      <p>You can allow your target to hear the source creature as if not under
      the effects of this power. When so allowing, you can tap into the hearing
      of your target as long as they are on the same plane as you are, and hear
      the voice of the source creature you specified. You only hear that voice,
      not that of your source target or any other sounds.

      </p>

      <p>The duration of mythic selective hearing becomes 1 hour/level and its
      saving throw becomes a Will save.
