      <p>You merge your biokinetic aura with that of your psicrystal, allowing
      your psicrystal to merge into your body. For the duration of the power,
      the psicrystal cannot be targeted in any way and cannot use any of its
      powers, but still gives you the benefits of having it close, such as
      Alertness. It cannot be detected in any way, but the effect can still be
      detected. The psicrystal can be discharged as a standard action.
