      <p>Inside everyone there is a spark that can be fanned into true power.
      You trigger a temporary awakening of psionic power inside a creature that
      had none before, temporarily sharing some of your own insights and fueling
      their internal power. The more powerful the target is, the more power they
      can contain, but their knowledge is temporary, a gift from you. Choose one
      1st level power that you know, as long as this power is in effect, you
      cannot use the power. The target gains access to that 1st level power,
      gains 1 power point and a manifester level of 1, and a number of bonus
      power points as if his hit dice was his manifester level and his highest
      mental ability score was his primary manifesting ability score (which it
      also is for purposes of this granted power). Each morning the target can
      meditate to regain these power points as normal but if they ever are
      reduced to 0 power points, this power ends. The target can also recharge
      their power points from cognizance crystals as if he was a true
      manifester. Both the original manifester and the target can end this power
      as a swift action at any time.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment: </strong>This power may be augmented in one or both of
      the following ways.

      </p><ol><li>For every 2 additional power points you spend, you can choose
      another 1st level power you know to gift the target, but you lose access
      to this power for the duration of this power.</li><li>If you spend 4
      additional power points, the target gains a 2nd level power in addition to
      the 1st level power and has an effective manifester level of 3 for the
      purposes of manifesting these powers. You lose access to this 2nd level
      power for the duration.</li></ol>
