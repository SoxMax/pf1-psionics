  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The target of the power becomes clumsy and moves in the worst possible
      way when attacked. The target is considered flanked to all attackers and
      all attacks on the subject gain a +4 circumstance bonus to confirm
      critical hits. Any fortification against sneak attacks and critical hits
      must be rolled twice, with the worse roll used to determine if the extra
      damage is negated.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> By spending an additional 6 power points, the
      target is considered flat-footed rather than flanked.
