      <p>You regress the targets mental faculties, making them dim-witted and
      coarse, perhaps even reducing them to an animal state. If the target fails
      its saving throw (Will for telepathy, Fortitude for psychometabolism), it
      takes a 1d6 penalty to Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma (this cannot
      reduce a score below 1). If the target’s ability score is reduced to 1,
      they cannot use any skills related to that ability score, cannot
      communicate clearly (or at all), cannot understand language, but can still
      identify friend and foe.

      <p><strong>Augment: </strong>This power may be augmented in one or more of
      the following ways.

      </p><ul><li>If you spend 2 additional power points, the range increases to
      Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft. / level).</li><li>For every 2 additional power
      points you spent, the penalty increases by 1d6.</li><li>If you spend 2
      additional power points, the duration changes to Instantaneous and the
      penalty can only be removed through the use of <em>psychic surgery, heal,
      wish, reality revision </em>or a similar power or spell.</li></ul>
