      <p>The penalty on your additional attacks for having a high base attack
      bonus is reduced by 5 (to a minimum of 0). For example, a character with a
      base attack bonus of +6 under the effects of this power would make full
      attacks at +6/+6 instead of +6/+1, before accounting for other modifiers.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> You may augment this power in one more of the
      following ways:

      </p><ol><li>If you spend an additional 5 power points, the penalty is
      reduced by 10.</li><li>If you spend 10 additional power points, the
      penalty is reduced by 15.</li><li>For every 4 additional power points you
      spend, the duration increases by 1 round.</li></ol>
