      <p>If you have a claw attack (either from an actual natural weapon or from
      an effect such as claws of the beast) or a bite attack (which could be a
      natural bite attack or one you gain by means of the power Karak's bite of
      the wolf ), you can use this power to provide one of your natural weapons
      a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> If you spend 4 additional power points, this
      power's duration increases to 1 hour per level. Additionally, for every 4
      additional power points you spend augmenting this power, this power
      improves the natural weapon's enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage
      rolls by 1. This bonus does not allow a natural weapon to bypass damage
      reduction aside from magic.
