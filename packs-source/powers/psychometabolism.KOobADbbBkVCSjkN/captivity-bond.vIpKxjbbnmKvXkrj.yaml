      <p>A thin film of colored oily liquid engulfs your target then appears to
      be absorbed into their skin, leaving them tinted to match. For the
      duration of this power, the altered creature can take only nonlethal
      damage from any source. If they are suffering from ongoing bleed damage,
      they will bleed nonlethally. This power only applies to effects that deal
      hit point damage, and it can only be manifested upon creatures that are
      not immune to nonlethal damage.
