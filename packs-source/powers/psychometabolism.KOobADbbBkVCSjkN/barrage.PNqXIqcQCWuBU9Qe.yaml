      <table><caption>Barrage and Attack rolls

      </caption><tr><td>Given the level at which barrage can be gained, it is
      possible to result in a player using it to make over a dozen attacks in
      one round. In the interest of game flow, it can be decided that the
      manifester makes a single attack roll (or one attack roll for a certain
      number of targets), rather than one attack roll per target. This can have
      the effect of drastically skewing the result of the power, as that one
      attack roll may be great, or it may be terrible, but it may help in terms
      of needing to make a massive number of attack rolls in a single turn.

      </td></tr></table>

      <p>You boost your movements to super-naturally high levels, allowing you
      to strike at many targets in what others perceive as the blink of an eye.
      Your actions are so rapid that they leave visual echoes of your previous
      positions in the air as you move, although these quickly fade.

      </p>

      <p>This round, as a full attack action, you may make a single ranged
      attack with one ranged weapon (or several thrown weapons of the same type)
      against each target within one range increment of your weapon, similar to
      the Whirlwind Attack feat. You still expend ammunition as normal for these
      attacks.

      </p>

      <p>You may not make more attacks with barrage than your manifester level.
