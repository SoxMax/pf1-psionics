      <p>Your body and all your equipment are subsumed by your shadow. As a
      living shadow, you blend perfectly into any other shadow and vanish in
      darkness. You appear as an unattached shadow in areas of full light.

      </p>

      <p>You can move at your normal speed, on any surface, including walls and
      ceilings, as well as across the surfaces of liquids—even up the face of a
      waterfall.

      </p>

      <p>Your space does not change, so you cannot move into locations you would
      not normally be able to move into.

      </p>

      <p>While in your shadow body, you gain damage reduction 10/magic and
      darkvision out to 60 feet. You are immune to extra damage from critical
      hits, ability damage, disease, drowning, and poison. You take only half
      damage from acid, electricity, and fire of all kinds.

      </p>

      <p>While affected by this power, you can be detected by powers that read
      thoughts, life, or presences (including true seeing), or if you make
      suspicious movements in lighted areas.

      </p>

      <p>You cannot harm anyone physically or manipulate any objects, but you
      can use your powers normally. Doing so may attract notice, but if you
      remain in a shadowed area, you get a +15 bonus on your Stealth check to
      remain unnoticed.
