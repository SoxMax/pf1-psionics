      <p>Upon manifesting this power, you are able to transfer your animus to an
      individual with a touch. To use this power, you must possess an <a
      href="/wiki/Animus_(system)" title="Animus (system)">animus pool</a>. The
      target of this power need not have an animus pool or a method of using it;
      if they do not, they may not use this animus for any reason, simply
      becoming harmlessly charged by it. You may transfer two points of animus
      to a target creature, and this energy lasts for one minute before
      dissipating harmlessly.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment: </strong>If you spend an additional 2 power points
      points, you may alter the range of this power to close range (25 feet + 5
      feet per two manifester levels) and the manifester must make a successful
      ranged touch attack on an unwilling target. If you spend an additional 1
      power point, you may transfer an additional two points of animus to the
      target.
