      <p>You can place yourself into a trance so deep that you are almost in
      suspended animation. Even powers that detect life or thought are incapable
      of determining that you are alive.

      </p>

      <p>While you are suspended, you are aware of your surroundings. You feel
      the passage of one day for every year that actually passes. Though on a
      slower schedule, you grow hungry after a "day" without food (though a year
      passes in actuality) and begin to suffer the effects of thirst and
      starvation as appropriate. Time-based physical effects like aging are
      similarly slowed down, although durations of psionic powers and similar
      effects are treated normally.

      </p>

      <p>If you take any damage, you come out of your trance 4 rounds later. The
      trance can also be ended by a successful use of dispel psionics. If you
      choose to dismiss the power, your trance ends 10 rounds later.
