    value: >-
      <p>You alter a creature's blood into a caustic fluid and adjust their
      veins and arteries to accommodate it. The target gains acid resistance 10.
      Additionally, when the target is damaged by a melee attack, its attacker
      must succeed at a Reflex save or take 3d6 points of acid damage. Attackers
      using a natural weapon suffer a –4 penalty to their save.

      </p>

      <p>Whenever the target takes damage from a bleed effect, creatures
      adjacent to the target must succeed at a Reflex save or suffer 3d6 points
      of acid damage.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> You may augment this power in the following
      ways:

      </p><ol><li>For every 2 power points you spend, its damage increases by
      one die (d6).</li><li>If you spend an additional 4 power points, creatures
      damaged by this power who fail their saves are also blinded until the
      beginning of their next turn.</li></ol>
