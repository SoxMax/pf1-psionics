      <p>You can readjust your body to boost one physical ability score at the
      expense of one or more other scores. Select one physical ability score you
      would like to boost, and increase it by the same amount that you decrease
      one or more other scores. All score decreases are treated as ability
      damage.

      </p>

      <p>You can boost your Strength, Dexterity or Constitution score by an
      amount equal to your manifester level (or any lesser amount), assuming you
      can afford to burn your other ability scores to such an extent.

      </p>

      <p>When the duration of this power expires, your ability boost also ends,
      but your ability damage remains until it is healed.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> You can augment this power in one or more of
      the following ways.

      </p><ol><li>If you spend 2 additional power points, the ability damage you
      suffer to increase another score is delayed until the power
      fades.</li><li>If you spend 4 additional power points, the power's
      duration increases to 1 minute/level (D).</li><li>If you spend 6
      additional power points, the ability damage you suffer to increase another
      score fades when the power's duration expires.</li></ol>
