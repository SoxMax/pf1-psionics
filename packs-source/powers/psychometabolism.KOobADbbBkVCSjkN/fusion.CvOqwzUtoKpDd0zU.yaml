          You and one touched willing creature of your type and your size or
          smaller
  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You and another willing, corporeal, living creature of the same or
      smaller size fuse into one being. As the manifester, you control the
      actions of the fused being. However, you can give up this control to the
      other creature. Once you give up control, you cannot regain it unless the
      other creature relinquishes it.

      </p>

      <p>The fused being has your current hit points plus the other creature's
      current hit points. The fused being knows all the powers you and the other
      creature know, has the sum of your and the other creature's power points,
      and knows or has prepared any spells you or the other creature possesses
      (if any). Likewise, all feats, racial abilities, and class features are
      pooled (if both creatures have the same ability, the fused being gains it
      only once). For each of the six ability scores, the fused being's score is
      the higher of yours and the other creature's, and the fused being also has
      the higher Hit Dice or manifester level—this effectively means the fused
      being uses the better saving throws, attack bonus, and skill modifiers of
      either member, and it manifests powers at the higher of the manifester
      levels that you or the other creature possessed before becoming fused.

      </p>

      <p>You decide what equipment is absorbed into the fused being and what
      equipment remains available for use. These fused items are restored once
      the power ends.

      </p>

      <p>When the power ends, the fused being separates. The other creature
      appears in an area adjacent to you that you determine. If separation
      occurs in a cramped space, the other creature is expelled through the
      Astral Plane, finally coming to rest materially in the nearest empty space
      and taking 1d6 points of damage for each 10 feet of solid material passed
      through.

      </p>

      <p>Damage taken by the fused being is split evenly between you and the
      other creature when the power ends. You do not leave the fusion with more
      hit points than you entered it with, unless you were damaged prior to the
      fusion and the fused being was subsequently healed. In a like manner, the
      fused being's remaining power points are split between you and the other
      creature (you can leave with more points than you entered with, as long as
      you don't exceed the maximum power points for your level and ability
      score). Ability damage and negative levels are also split between you and
      the other creature. (If an odd number of negative levels or ability score
      reductions must be split, you decide whether you or the other creature
      receives the additional loss.)

      </p>

      <p>If a fused being is killed, it separates into its constituent
      creatures, both of which are also dead. You cannot use fission on a fused
      being.
