      <p>You generate a subtle telekinetic field of mental contact, allowing you
      to "feel" your surroundings even in total darkness or when your sight
      would otherwise be obscured by your physical environment. Your touchsight
      field emanates from you out to 60 feet. You ignore invisibility, darkness,
      and concealment, though you must have line of effect to a creature or an
      object to discern it. You do not need to make Perception checks to notice
      creatures; you can detect and pinpoint all creatures within 60 feet. In
      many circumstances, comparing your regular senses to what you learn with
      touchsight is enough to tell you the difference between visible,
      invisible, hiding, and concealed creatures.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every 2 additional power points you
      spend, the radius of your touchsight field increases by 10 feet.
