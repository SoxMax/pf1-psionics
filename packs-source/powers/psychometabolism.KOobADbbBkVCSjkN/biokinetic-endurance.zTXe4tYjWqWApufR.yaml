      <p>You alter your body's rhythms, defending yourself against crippling
      attacks and turning your skin (as well as fur, feathers, or scales) a pale
      gray color. Whenever damage would be dealt to one of your physical ability
      scores by a source other than you, reduce that damage by 2 points, to a
      minimum of 0. Once this power as prevented an amount of ability damage
      equal to your manifester level, it ends immediately.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every 2 additional power points you
      spend, the ability damage reduced by this power, as well as the maximum
      amount of damage that can be prevented, increases by 1 point.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Surge Augmentation:</strong> If you invoke your wild surge
      while manifesting this power, choose one of the following augmentations: 

      </p><ol><li>The power's range changes to close (25 ft. plus 5 ft. per 2
      levels) and its target changes to 'one creature.'</li><li>. You gain DR
      X/—, where X is equal to your wild surge's intensity.</li></ol>
