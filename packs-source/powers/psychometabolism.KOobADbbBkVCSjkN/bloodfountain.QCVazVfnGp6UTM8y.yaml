    value: >-
      <p>Your press your fingers against the pliant flesh of your enemy and
      through this contact tap into its bloodstream, overloading its capacity.
      When you manifest this power, your target’s blood pressure (or similar
      life-giving fluid) increases to the point that vessels begin to burst. A
      creature affected by <em>bloodfountain </em>begins to leak their precious
      fluids out of eyes, ears, or other openings. Such a creature bleeds 2 hit
      points of damage at the start of its turn each round. This bleed damage
      functions as normal, requiring a DC 15 Heal check or magical healing to
      stop.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment: </strong>For every two additional power points you
      spend, the bleed damage increases by one each round and the DC also
      increases by one.
