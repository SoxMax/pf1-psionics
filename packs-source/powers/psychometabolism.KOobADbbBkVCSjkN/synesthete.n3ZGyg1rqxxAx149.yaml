      <p>You receive one kind of sensory input when a different sense is
      stimulated. In particular, you can either feel light or feel sound. You
      can shift your stimulated sense between these two options once per round
      as a swift action. Your senses continue to work normally as well, unless
      they are impaired for some reason.

      </p>

      <p>Your face must be uncovered to use this power, because it is the skin
      of your face that acts as the sensory receiver.

      </p>

      <p>If you are feeling light by absorbing ambient light onto your skin, you
      have your normal visual abilities (except for darkvision), even if your
      eyes are closed or you are blinded. If your eyes are working normally, you
      gain a +4 circumstance bonus on all visual Perception checks. While
      feeling light, you are immune to gaze attacks.

      </p>

      <p>If you are feeling sound by absorbing sound onto your skin and your
      ears are working normally, the expanded audio input provides you with a +4
      circumstance bonus on Perception checks to listen.

      </p>

      <p>Psionic or magical displacement effects, invisibility effects,
      illusions, and other similar effects confuse your synesthete senses just
      as they would your normal senses.

      </p>

      <p>You can also use this power to see sound if you are deafened, or hear
      light if you are blinded, thus removing all penalties associated with
      either condition (though you gain no bonuses for using the power in this
      way if you are not deafened or blinded).
