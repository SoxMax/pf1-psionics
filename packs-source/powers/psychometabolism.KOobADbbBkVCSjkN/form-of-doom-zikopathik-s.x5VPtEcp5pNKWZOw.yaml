      <p>You wrench from your subconscious a terrifying visage of deadly hunger
      and become one with it. You are transformed into a nightmarish version of
      yourself, complete with an ooze-sleek skin coating, lashing tentacles, and
      a frightinducing countenance. You effectively gain a +10 bonus on Disguise
      checks to hide your identity and instead appear as a horrific monster,
      though you retain your basic shape and can continue to use your equipment.
      While using this power, you cannot impersonate a specific individual.

      </p>

      <p>You gain the frightful presence extraordinary ability, which takes
      effect automatically when you charge a foe. Opponents within 30 feet of
      you that have fewer Hit Dice or levels than you and that witness your
      charge become shaken for 5d6 rounds if they fail a Will save (DC 16 + your
      Cha modifier). An opponent that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to
      your frightful presence for 24 hours. Frightful presence is a
      mind-affecting fear effect.

      </p>

      <p>Your horrific form grants you a natural armor bonus of +5, damage
      reduction 5/–, and a +4 bonus to your Strength score. In addition, you
      gain +10 feet to your land speed as well as a +10 bonus on Climb checks
      and Acrobatic checks made to jump.

      </p>

      <p>A nest of violently flailing black tentacles sprout from your hair and
      back. You can make up to four additional attacks with these tentacles in
      addition to your regular melee attacks in each round that you take a full
      attack action. You can make tentacle attacks within the space you normally
      threaten. If you make your tentacle attacks in addition to you regular
      melee attacks, each tentacle attacks at your highest base attack bonus
      with a –5 penalty. If you forgo all your other attacks, making only
      tentacle attacks, you make your tentacle attacks at your highest base
      attack bonus with no penalty. These tentacles deal 2d8 points of damage
      plus one-half your Strength bonus on each successful strike.

      </p>

      <p>This power functions only while you inhabit your base form (for
      instance, you can't be metamorphed or polymorphed into another form,
      though you can use claws of the beast, and Karak's bite of the wolf in
      conjunction with this power for your regular attacks), and while your mind
      resides within your own body.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every additional power point you spend,
      this power's duration increases by 2 rounds.
