      <p>This power cures all ability damage, and it restores all points drained
      from a single ability score (your choice if more than one score is
      drained). It also eliminates any fatigue or exhaustion suffered by the
      target. Cleanse spirit does not restore levels or Constitution points lost
      due to death.

      </p>

      <p>Cleanse spirit can remove negative levels. It can also restore one
      level to a creature that has had a level drained, if the number of days
      since the creature lost the level is equal to or less than your manifester
      level. In such a case, cleanse spirit brings the creature up to the
      minimum number of experience points necessary to advance it to the next
      higher level, gaining it an additional Hit Die and level benefits
      accordingly.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> By spending an additional 6 power points, the
      power dispels all permanent and temporary negative levels afflicting the
      healed creature. The power also dispels all psionic effects penalizing the
      creature's abilities, cures all temporary ability damage, and restores all
      points permanently drained from all ability scores. It also eliminates
      fatigue and exhaustion, and removes all forms of insanity, confusion, and
      similar mental effects.
