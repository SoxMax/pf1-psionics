  description:
    value: >-
      <p>When you manifest this power, your body creates a perfect copy of
      yourself into a single adjacent square. As long as the twin exists,
      whenever you take a move action to move, the twin can move as well,
      although it does not need to follow you and cannot take any other actions.
      On subsequent rounds, at the start of your turn, your mind can
      instantaneously exchange places with your twin, becoming the twin and your
      original body becoming the twin. This is not an action and does not
      provoke an attack of opportunity.

      </p>

      <p>The twin has a speed of 30 feet and provokes attacks of opportunity
      from movement as normal. Your twin cannot speak while you are in your
      other body, and cannot flank, make attacks of opportunity, or otherwise
      threaten enemies. It has an AC equal to 10 + 1/2 your manifester level and
      a number of hit points equal to your manifester level. If the twin is
      reduced to 0 hit points, it is destroyed, although you can create a new
      one on your turn as a standard action as long as the duration persists.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> This power can be augmented in one or more of
      the following ways.

      </p><ol><li>If you spend 2 additional power points, the duration extends
      to 1 minute/lvl.</li><li>For every 2 additional power points you spend,
      you create another cloned twin.</li><li>If you spend 4 additional power
      points, the twin uses your AC, movement speeds, movement modes and hit
      points at the time of the split, and retains any spells, powers or effects
      that were affecting you when you split.</li><li>If you spend 2 additional
      power points, if you are reduced to 0 hit points, you can freely shift
      your consciousness into the twin, while the body you inhabited is
      destroyed.</li></ol>
