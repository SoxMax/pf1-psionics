      <p>Any armor you are wearing becomes a natural extension of your body, and
      blends seamlessly with your form. Now that the armor and you are one, your
      Maximum Dexterity Bonus increases by 1, the armor's Armor Check Penalty is
      reduced by 1 (to a minimum of 0), any arcane spell failure is reduced by
      10%, and the armor is treated as one step lighter for all purposes except
      armor proficiency (light armor is still considered light armor).

      </p>

      <p>When this power's duration expires, the armor detaches normally and
      remains equipped.
