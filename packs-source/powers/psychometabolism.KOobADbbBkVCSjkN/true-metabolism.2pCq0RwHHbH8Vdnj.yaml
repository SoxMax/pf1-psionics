      <p>You are difficult to kill while this power persists. You automatically
      heal damage at the rate of 10 hit points per round.

      </p>

      <p>This power is not effective against damage from starvation, thirst, or
      suffocation. Also, attack forms that don't deal hit point damage (for
      example, most poisons) ignore true metabolism. You can also use this power
      to regrow lost portions of your body and to reattach severed limbs or body
      parts, if you do nothing but concentrate on regrowing the lost body part
      or reattaching the severed limb for the duration of the power. You do not
      gain the benefits described earlier when you manifest true metabolism for
      this purpose. You must have a Constitution score to gain any of this
      power's benefits.
