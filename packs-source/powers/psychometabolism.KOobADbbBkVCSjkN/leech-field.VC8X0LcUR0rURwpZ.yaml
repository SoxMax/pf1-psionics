      <p>You raise a field of potentiality that drains the vitality from powers
      that you successfully save against. When you succeed on a saving throw
      against a foe's power on you, your body erupts in a brief flash of
      crackling dark energy. You gain 1 power point for every 2 power points
      your foe spent to manifest the power you just saved against (to a maximum
      number of points equal to your manifester level). You cannot gain power
      points that would cause you to exceed your normal daily maximum.

      </p>

      <p>This power is effective against any power that targets a single
      creature or has an area of effect and allows the target a saving throw.
      This power also works against spells that would affect you. The power
      points gained from saving against spells is 1 power point per spell level
      cast.

      </p>

      <p>If multiple creatures are under the effect of leech field and succeed
      on a saving throw against the same manifestation of a power or casting of
      a spell, the power points that would be gained are divided evenly among
      all affected creatures. For example, if two creatures under the effect of
      leech field successfully saved against a 12 power point manifestation of
      energy ball, each would only gain 3 power points.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every 2 additional power points you
      spend, this power's duration increases by 1 minute.
