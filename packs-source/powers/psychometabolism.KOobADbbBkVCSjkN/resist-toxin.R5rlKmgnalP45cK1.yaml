      <p>You become temporarily immune to poison. Any poison in your system or
      any poison to which you are exposed during the power's duration does not
      affect you until the duration has expired. This does not cure any damage
      that poison may have already done.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> This power may be augmented in one of the
      following ways.

      </p><ol><li>If you spend 2 additional power points, this power can instead
      cure all diseases from you are suffering. You must make a manifesting
      level check (1d20 + manifester level) against the DC of each disease
      affecting you. Success means that the disease is cured. The power's
      duration changes to Instantaneous when using this augment option. This
      does not prevent reinfection after a new exposure to the same disease at a
      later date.</li><li>If you spend 4 additional power points, this power can
      instead detoxify any sort of venom in you. You must make a manifester
      level check (1d20 + manifester level) against the DC of each poison
      affecting you. Success means that the poison is neutralized. You suffer no
      additional effects from the neutralized poison, and any temporary effects
      are ended, but this does not reverse instantaneous effects, such as hit
      point damage, temporary ability damage, or effects that don't go away on
      their own. The power's duration changes to Instantaneous when using this
      augment option.</li></ol>
