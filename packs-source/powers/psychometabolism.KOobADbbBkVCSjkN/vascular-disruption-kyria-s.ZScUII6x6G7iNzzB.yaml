      <p>You violently disturb your victim's vascular system, sending an
      eruption of gooey blood from their body. Your victim suffers 9d6 points of
      damage and erupts in a 20 ft. burst of blood. Creatures within the burst
      (including the victim) become entangled for 1 round/level as the blood
      congeals into a web-like mass that constricts their movement. A successful
      Fortitude save halves the damage and prevents the burst of blood.
      Creatures without blood or an equivalent bodily fluid (including, but not
      limited to, most forms of undead, constructs, and elementals) are immune
      to the effects of this power.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> You may augment this power in the following
      ways.

      </p><ol><li>For every 1 additional power point you spend, this power's
      damage increases by one die (d6). For each two extra dice of damage, this
      power's save DC increases by 1.</li><li>If you spend 4 additional power
      points, the eruption of blood occurs even if the victim succeeds at their
      saving throw.</li></ol>

      <p><strong>Surge Augmentation:</strong> If you invoke your wild surge
      while manifesting this power, you may affect creatures that do not have
      blood or equivalent bodily fluids; you convert part of their form to
      liquid and force it outward.
