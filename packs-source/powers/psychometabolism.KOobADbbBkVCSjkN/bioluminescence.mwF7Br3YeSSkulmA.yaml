  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A glowing ball of dim light fades into perceptibility around the
      caverns nearby, revealing the tiny natural plants living there, but never
      fades away. To manifest this power, you must target an area of existing
      small-scale plant life (no more complex than simple grasses). The
      chemistry of any of these plants within the area of your power is altered
      so the plants naturally emit dim light. This alteration is fueled by a
      symbiotic link between you and the plant life, which continue to produce
      light as long as you remain within range and one hour thereafter. If you
      return within range of glowing plants before they extinguish, they relink
      to you automatically and resume feeding harmlessly on your excess mental
      energy.

      </p>

      <p>The illumination emitted by these plants is non-psionic in nature,
      raising the ambient lighting level of the area naturally, which may
      prevail in circumstances where magic or psionic illumination and darkness
      powers have cancelled one another out.
