      <p>This power causes instant growth, doubling your height, length, and
      width and multiplying your weight by 8. This increase changes your size
      category to the next larger one. You gain a +2 size bonus to Strength, a
      –2 size penalty to Dexterity (to a minimum of 1), a –1 size penalty on
      attack rolls and AC due to your increased size.

      </p>

      <p>If your new size is Large or larger, you have a space of at least 10
      feet and a natural reach of at least 10 feet. This power does not change
      your speed.

      </p>

      <p>If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, you attain
      the maximum possible size and can make a Strength check (using your
      increased Strength score) to burst any enclosures in the process. If you
      fail, you are constrained without harm by the materials enclosing you— you
      cannot crush yourself to death by increasing your size.

      </p>

      <p>All your equipment, worn or carried, is similarly expanded by this
      power. Melee and projectile weapons deal more damage.

      </p>

      <p>Other psionic or magical properties are not affected by this power. Any
      affected item that leaves your possession (including a projectile or
      thrown weapon) instantly returns to its normal size. This means that
      thrown weapons deal their normal damage (projectiles deal damage based on
      the size of the weapon that fired them). Multiple effects that increase
      size do not stack, which means (among other things) that you can't use a
      second manifestation of this power to further expand yourself.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> You can augment this power in one or more of
      the following ways.

      </p><ol><li>If you spend 6 additional power points, this power increases
      your size by two size categories instead of one. You gain a +4 size bonus
      to Strength, a –4 size penalty to Dexterity (to a minimum effective
      Dexterity score of 1), a –2 size penalty on attack rolls, and a –2 size
      penalty to Armor Class due to your increased size.</li><li>If you spend 6
      additional power points, you can manifest this power as a swift action
      instead of a standard action.</li><li>If you spend 2 additional power
      points, this power's duration is 10 minutes per level rather than 1 minute
      per level.</li></ol>
