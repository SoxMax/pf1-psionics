      <p>You accelerate the body of the touched target and you can choose to
      affect only detrimental effects, only positive effects or all effects.

      </p>

      <p><em>Detrimental: </em>Every poison, disease, ongoing spell effect with
      a negative effect over time triggers once more as if at least one day had
      passed (reducing onset time, triggering more saves against diseases or
      poisons, but only one and so on). A successful saving throw does not count
      toward ending the affliction, and this extra save does not change the
      timing of the next save against the affliction. The target can make a
      Fortitude save to negate this effect.

      </p>

      <p><em>Positive: </em>The target heals physical ability damage as if they
      had rested for a day, gain a new save against any ongoing effects or
      spells that give new saves after a day and heal their hit dice in hit
      point damage. No save.

      </p>

      <p><em>All:</em> Both of the above effects trigger at the same time. The
      target gains no save.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment: </strong>This power may be augmented in one or more of
      the following ways.

      </p><ul><li>If you spend 2 additional power points, the range changes from
      Touch to Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels).</li><li>For every 2 additional
      power points you spend, the effects trigger as if another day had
      passed.</li><li>For every 2 additional power points you spend, you can
      affect another target with this power.</li></ul>
