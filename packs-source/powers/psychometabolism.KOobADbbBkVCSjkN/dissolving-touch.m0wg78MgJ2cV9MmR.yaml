      <p>Your touch, claw, or bite is corrosive, and sizzling moisture visibly
      oozes from your natural weapon or hand. You deal 4d6 points of acid damage
      to any creature or object you touch with your successful melee touch
      attack. Acid you secrete denatures 1 round after use, losing all efficacy
      and ability to deal damage. You are immune to your own acid.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every 2 additional power points you
      spend, this power's damage increases by 1d6 points.
