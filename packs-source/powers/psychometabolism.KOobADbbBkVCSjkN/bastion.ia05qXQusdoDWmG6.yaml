      <p>A fluttering of your eyelashes reveals your concentration as you expend
      extraordinary effort restructuring the biological makeup of your ally,
      granting them extra ability. When you manifest this power upon an ally
      with the ability to form an astral suit, they gain an extra customization
      point which they can spend on their turn as a free action. When this power
      expires, the customization invested is removed automatically.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment: </strong>For every four additional power points you
      spend, the recipient is granted an additional customization point.
