      <p>As @UUID[Compendium.pf1-psionics.powers.Item.B1T1tEAotwMAmZOw]{Energy
      Adaptation}, except that instead of radiating away energy as light, you
      store up the energy and can later discharge it as a ray. To discharge a
      ray requires a standard action. You can choose to fire any number of rays
      during the power's duration. The ray you fire must be of one of the energy
      types you have stored (if you have stored more than one type, you can
      choose what kind of energy to use for each ray). If a ray successfully
      strikes its target (requiring a ranged touch attack), the target takes
      damage equal to the amount of energy damage of that type you have stored,
      up to a maximum of three times your manifester level. As long as this
      power remains in effect, you can continue to absorb energy damage and fire
      additional rays using the stored damage. Damage you fire in rays is
      subtracted from the damage you have absorbed, so you may not fire off rays
      if you have depleted the energy you have absorbed.

      </p>

      <p>This power's subtype is the same as the type of energy you discharge in
      a ray; thus, its subtype can change during the course of the power's
      duration.
