      <p>You can improve your chances in a grapple as an immediate action,
      gaining a +4 enhancement bonus to your combat maneuver rolls to grapple.

      </p>

      <p>You can manifest this power with an instant thought, quickly enough to
      gain the benefit of the power in the current round. Manifesting this power
      is an immediate action. You can manifest this power when it isn't your
      turn (if you are grappled).

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every 2 additional power points you
      spend, the enhancement bonus increases by 1.
