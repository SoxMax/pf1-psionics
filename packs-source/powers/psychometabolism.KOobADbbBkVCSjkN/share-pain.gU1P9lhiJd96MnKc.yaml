      <p>This power creates a psychometabolic connection between you and a
      willing subject so that some of your wounds are transferred to the
      subject. You take half damage from all attacks that deal hit point damage
      to you, and the subject takes the remainder. If your hit points are
      reduced by a lowered Constitution score, that reduction is not shared with
      the subject because it is not a form of hit point damage. When this power
      ends, subsequent damage is no longer divided between the subject and you,
      but damage already shared is not reassigned.

      </p>

      <p>If you and the subject move farther away from each other than close
      range, the power ends.

      </p>

      <p>You can manifest this power on two willing subjects, one of which you
      designate to share its damage with the other.
