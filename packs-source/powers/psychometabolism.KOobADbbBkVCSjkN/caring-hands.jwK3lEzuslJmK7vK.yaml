      <p>You must be a <a href="/wiki/Highlord" title="Highlord">Highlord</a>
      following the <a href="/wiki/Caretaker_(Tenets_of_Cultivation)"
      title="Caretaker (Tenets of Cultivation)">Caretaker (Tenets of
      Cultivation)</a> to manifest this power. You cannot learn this power with
      the <a href="/wiki/Expanded_Knowledge" title="Expanded Knowledge">Expanded
      Knowledge</a> feat or similar abilities.

      </p>

      <p>When you use this power, you can remove a condition or damage affecting
      a member of your collective, based on how many powers points were spent on
      the power. Choose one option from the following table to treat:

      </p><table><tr><th>Power Points Spent

      </th><th>Condition Treated

      </th></tr><tr><td>1

      </td><td>Compulsion or charm, up to 4 hit points + 2 hit points per pp
      spent augmenting the power

      </td></tr><tr><td>3

      </td><td>Fatigue, paralysis, poison, up to 4 points of ability damage

      </td></tr><tr><td>5

      </td><td>Blindness, deafness, disease

      </td></tr><tr><td>7

      </td><td>Up to 2 points of ability drain, up to 1 negative level

      </td></tr><tr><td>9

      </td><td>Curses, enchantment and telepathy effects, transmutation and
      psychometabolism effects

      </td></tr><tr><td>11

      </td><td>Lost limbs, petrification

      </td></tr></table>

      <p>In order to treat a magical effect, you must succeed at a manifester
      level check (1d20 + your manifester level) against a DC of 11 + the
      effect’s caster level, and in order to treat a curse, disease, or poison,
      you must succeed at a manifester level check against the condition’s save
      DC.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment: </strong>This power can be augmented in one or more of
      the following ways.

      </p><ol><li>For every additional power point you spend, allies you affect
      with this power gain 2 temporary hit points. These temporary hit points
      last for 1 minute or until used.</li><li>For every 2 power points you
      spend, you gain a +1 bonus on your manifester level checks to remove
      conditions that require a check.</li><li>For every 2 power points you
      spend, you can affect an additional creature, curing them of the same
      conditions or amount of damage.</li><li>For ever 4 power points you spend,
      you can remove another condition. You may only choose a given type of
      damage once per use of this power (for example, if you spent 3 power
      points, you could heal 8 hit points and remove the ally’s fatigue, but
      could not choose “hit points” twice to heal more hit points).</li></ol>
