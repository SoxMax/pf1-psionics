      following the <a

      the @UUID[Compendium.pf1-psionics.feats.Item.c0UEsI7FACYLayaw]{Expanded
      Knowledge} feat or similar abilities.</p><p>When you use this power, you
      can remove a condition or damage affecting a member of your collective,
      based on how many powers points were spent on the power. Choose one option
      from the following table to treat:</p><table><tbody><tr><th><p>Power
      Points Spent</p></th><th><p>Condition
      Treated</p></th></tr><tr><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>Compulsion or charm, up
      to 4 hit points + 2 hit points per pp spent augmenting the
      power</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>Fatigue, paralysis, poison,
      up to 4 points of ability
      damage</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>5</p></td><td><p>Blindness, deafness,
      disease</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>7</p></td><td><p>Up to 2 points of ability
      drain, up to 1 negative
      level</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>9</p></td><td><p>Curses, enchantment and
      telepathy effects, transmutation and psychometabolism
      effects</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>11</p></td><td><p>Lost limbs,
      petrification</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>In order to treat a magical
      effect, you must succeed at a manifester level check (1d20 + your
      manifester level) against a DC of 11 + the effect’s caster level, and in
      order to treat a curse, disease, or poison, you must succeed at a
      manifester level check against the condition’s save
      DC.</p><p><strong>Augment: </strong>This power can be augmented in one or
      more of the following ways.</p><ol><li>For every additional power point
      you spend, allies you affect with this power gain 2 temporary hit points.
      These temporary hit points last for 1 minute or until used.</li><li>For
      every 2 power points you spend, you gain a +1 bonus on your manifester
      level checks to remove conditions that require a check.</li><li>For every
      2 power points you spend, you can affect an additional creature, curing
      them of the same conditions or amount of damage.</li><li>For ever 4 power
      points you spend, you can remove another condition. You may only choose a
      given type of damage once per use of this power (for example, if you spent
      3 power points, you could heal 8 hit points and remove the ally’s fatigue,
      but could not choose “hit points” twice to heal more hit
      points).</li></ol>
