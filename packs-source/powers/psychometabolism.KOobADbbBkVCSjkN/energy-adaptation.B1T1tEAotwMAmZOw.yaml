      <p>Your body assimilates some of the effect of an energy attack and
      converts it to harmless light. You gain resistance 10 against any attack
      that deals acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage.

      </p>

      <p>When you absorb damage, you can choose to radiate visible light that
      illuminates a 60-foot radius for a number of rounds equal to the points of
      damage you successfully resisted, or merely dissipate the energy without
      giving off a visual display.

      </p>

      <p>The energy resistance provided by this power increases to 20 points at
      7th manifester level and to a maximum of 30 points at 11th level.

      </p>

      <p>The power protects your equipment as well.

      </p>

      <p>The resistance provided by this power does not stack with other forms
      of energy resistance.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> If you spend 4 additional power points, you
      can manifest this power as an immediate action.
