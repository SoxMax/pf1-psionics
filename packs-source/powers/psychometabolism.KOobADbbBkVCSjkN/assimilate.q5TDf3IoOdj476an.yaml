    value: >-
      <p>Your pointing finger turns black as obsidian. A creature touched by you
      is partially assimilated into your form and takes 20d6 points of damage.
      Any creature reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by this power is killed,
      entirely assimilated into your form, leaving behind only a trace of fine
      dust. An assimilated creature's equipment is unaffected.

      </p>

      <p>A creature that is partially assimilated into your form (that is, a
      creature that has at least 1 hit point following your use of this power)
      grants you a number of temporary hit points equal to half the damage you
      dealt for 1 hour. Temporary hit points gained by assimilating multiple
      creatures, like all

      temporary hit points, do not stack.

      </p>

      <p>A creature that is completely assimilated grants you a number of
      temporary hit points equal to the hit points it had prior to your attack.
      If the assimilated creature knows psionic powers, you gain knowledge of
      one of its powers for 1 hour (chosen randomly). You gain some semblance of
      a creature you completely assimilate for 1 hour, granting you a +10 bonus
      on Disguise checks made to appear as that creature during that time. You
      also gain a bonus to your ability scores for 1 hour for completely
      assimilating creatures based upon the creature's relative hit dice related
      to yours as shown on the chart below.
