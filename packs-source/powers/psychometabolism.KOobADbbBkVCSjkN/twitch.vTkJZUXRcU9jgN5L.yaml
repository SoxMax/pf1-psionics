    value: >-
      <p>If the target fails its saving throw (Fortitude if this is a
      psychometabolism power, Will if this is a telepathy power), you can
      immediately force them to do one of the following as their body spasms:

      </p><ul><li>Drop something held in one hand</li><li>Take a 5-foot step in
      any direction (this does not provoke attacks of opportunity)</li><li>Fall
      prone</li></ul>

      <p>If the target succeeds on their save, they take a –1 penalty to their
      next d20 roll as the focus required to keep their body from twitching
      distracts them.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment: </strong>This power may be augmented in one or more of
      the following ways.

      </p><ol><li>For every 2 additional power points you spend, you can choose
      another target.</li><li>If you spend 2 additional power points, the range
      becomes Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./lvl).</li></ol>

      <p>For every 2 power points spent on the above augments, increase the save
      DC by 1.
