      <p>Your posture becomes stooped forward, and you grow a muzzle complete
      with fangs. You gain one bite attack each round, instead of or in addition
      to any other attacks you have, that deals 1d8 points of damage (assuming
      you are a Medium creature) when it hits.

      </p>

      <p>Your bite attack is a natural weapon, so you are considered armed when
      attacking with it, and it can be affected by powers, spells, and effects
      that enhance or improve natural weapons. You can choose to deal nonlethal
      damage with your bite, taking the standard –4 penalty on your attack roll.
      Like all natural claw attacks, the bite is a primary natural attack unless
      you also make attacks with manufactured weapons, in which case it becomes
      a secondary natural attack.

      </p>

      <p>If you are not a Medium creature, your bite attack's base damage varies
      as follows: Fine 1d2, Diminutive 1d3, Tiny 1d4, Small 1d6, Large 2d6, Huge
      2d8, Gargantuan 4d6, Colossal 6d6.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every 5 additional power points you
      spend, your bite attack deals an additional 1d8 points of damage.
