      <p>You brutally rewrite the pattern of your target, leaving them
      vulnerable to further attack. If your target fails its saving throw,
      choose bludgeoning, cold, fire, electricity, piercing, slashing, or sonic
      damage. Your victim suffers 50% additional damage from sources that deal
      damage of the chosen type for the duration of this power.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> You may augment this power in one or both of
      the following ways.

      </p><ol><li>For every 2 additional power points you spend, your target
      suffers 1d6 points of untyped damage as their pattern is violently rent by
      your will.</li><li>For every 4 additional power points you spend, this
      power affects an additional target within range.</li></ol>

      <p>In addition, for every 2 power points spent on either of the above
      options, the power's save DC is increased by 1.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Surge Augmentation:</strong> If you invoke your wild surge when
      manifesting this power, the damage dealt by its first augment option is of
      the type chosen when your victim failed their saving throw (and therefore
      deals 50% more damage).
