        value: Duplicate of yourself
  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You can divide yourself, creating a duplicate that comes into existence
      5 feet away. Your duplicate thinks and acts exactly as you do and follows
      your orders, although it will not do anything you wouldn't do yourself.
      Your duplicate has all your abilities but none of your psionic or magical
      equipment (it does possess a duplicate of all your mundane equipment,
      clothing, armor, and implements, as well as mundane versions of any
      psionic or magical equipment you have). You and your duplicate evenly
      split your power points, your remaining usages of pertinent special
      abilities for the day, and so on. You retain your psionic focus, if you
      maintain such when this power is manifested. Treat your duplicate as
      yourself with a manifester level two lower for the purpose of determining
      the powers to which the duplicate has access (while the duration of this
      power lasts, this manifester level penalty cannot be removed by any
      means). Your duplicate has all other physical traits you had at the time
      you manifest this power. Powers, spells, or other effects affecting you
      when you manifest this power do not transfer to your duplicate. Your
      duplicate has the same number of hit points you did at the time this power
      was manifested.

      </p>

      <p>When the duration expires or when you dismiss the power, you and your
      duplicate rejoin, no matter how far from each other you are. You gain back
      any power points the duplicate has not spent. At the time of rejoining,
      your hit points become the average between the current hit points of you
      and your duplicate. This could potentially leave you with negative hit
      points, but it can't reduce your hit points so low as to kill you when the
      duration ends.

      </p>

      <p>If your duplicate dies before the duration expires, no rejoining
      occurs, and you gain one negative level and are sickened for ten minutes.
      If you die, your duplicate remains in existence and is sickened for ten
      minutes, and is for all intents you, but with two negative levels, and
      without the manifester level penalty. (Once the duration expires, the
      negative levels can be removed by standard means.)

      </p>

      <p>You can have only one fissioned duplicate in existence at one time;
      your duplicate cannot use this power. You cannot use fusion or metaconcert
      with a duplicate, or share any other power or effect that pools abilities
      (the sum of you and you is still just you). Similarly, attempting to use
      powers such as claws of the vampire or vampiric blade to hurt your
      duplicate only damages your duplicate; these powers do not heal you.
      Empathic transfer and similar powers are likewise ineffective
      (transferring wounds to yourself isn't a good healing strategy).

      </p>

      <p>All beneficial powers affecting a fissioned creature, either the
      original or the duplicate, end when the fission ends. Any detrimental
      powers affecting your duplicate end when the duration ends, unless you die
      and your duplicate survives, in which case any detrimental effects on your
      duplicate continue. All ability damage, ability drain, and ability burn
      damage is added together, although as stated above, your hit points become
      the average hit points between you and your duplicate.
