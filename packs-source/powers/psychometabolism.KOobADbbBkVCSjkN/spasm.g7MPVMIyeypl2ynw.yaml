      <p>If the target fails its saving throw (Fortitude if this is a
      psychometabolism power, Will if this is a telepathy power), they begin to
      spasm uncontrollably, hurting themselves and making movement hard. The
      target takes 5d6 damage from their spasms, and during their next turn,
      their speed is halved.

      </p>

      <p>If the target succeeds on their save, they take a –1 penalty to their
      next d20 roll and a 5 foot penalty to their speed as the focus required to
      keep their body from spasming distracts them.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment: </strong>This power may be augmented in one or more of
      the following ways.

      </p><ol><li>For every 1 power point you spend on augmenting this power, it
      deals 1d6 more damage.</li><li>For every 2 additional power points you
      spend, you can choose another target.</li><li>If you spend 2 additional
      power points, the range becomes Medium (100 ft. + 10ft/lvl.).</li></ol>

      <p>For every 2 power points spent on the above augments, increase the save
      DC by 1
