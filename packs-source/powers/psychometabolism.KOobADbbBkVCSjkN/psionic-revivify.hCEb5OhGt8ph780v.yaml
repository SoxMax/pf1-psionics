      <p>Psionic revivify lets a manifester reconnect a corpse's psyche with its
      body, restoring life to a recently deceased creature. The power must be
      manifested within 1 round of the victim's death. Before the psyche of the
      deceased has completely left the body, this power halts its journey while
      repairing somewhat the damage to the body.

      </p>

      <p>This power functions like the raise dead spell, except that the
      affected creature receives a permanent negative levels, but suffers no
      Constitution loss, and no loss of powers.

      </p>

      <p>The creature has –1 hit points (but is stable) after being restored to
      life.

      </p>

      <p>For every additional negative level that the subject suffers, the
      manifestation of this power can be delayed by 2 additional rounds. All of
      the negative levels gained in this manner fade after twenty-four hours.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> By spending 2 additional power points, this
      power may also affect outsiders.
