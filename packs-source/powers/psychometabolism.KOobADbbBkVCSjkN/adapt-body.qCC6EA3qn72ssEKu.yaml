      <p>Your body automatically adapts to hostile environments. You can adapt
      to underwater, extremely hot, extremely cold, or airless environments,
      allowing you to survive as if you were a creature native to that
      environment. You can breathe and move (though penalties to movement and
      attacks, if any for a particular environment, remain), and you take no
      damage simply from being in that environment. You need not specify what
      environment you are adapting to when you manifest this power; simply
      activate it, and your body will instantly adapt to any hostile environment
      as needed throughout the duration.

      </p>

      <p>You can somewhat adapt to extreme environmental features such as acid,
      lava, fire, and electricity. Any environmental feature that normally
      directly deals 1 or more dice of damage per round deals you only half the
      usual amount of damage.
