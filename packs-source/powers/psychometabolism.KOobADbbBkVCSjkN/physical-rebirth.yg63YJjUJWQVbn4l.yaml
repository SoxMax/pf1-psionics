    value: >-
      <p>Using special oils and powdered crystals (worth 1000 gp), you draw out
      the impurities and heal the ravages of time on a single living creature.
      You reverse the effects of aging, returning the target to the youngest
      mature age for their race, removing any and all physical penalties for
      age. However, this transformation is draining and the target takes 2
      permanent negative levels after this process is complete.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> This power may be augmented in one or more of
      the following ways.

      </p><ol><li>For every 2 additional power points and an extra 1000 gp, the
      target takes 1 less permanent negative level.</li><li>If you spend 4
      additional power points and an additional 5000 gp, you can target a
      creature that died in the last week, bringing them back to life at their
      youngest state.</li></ol>
