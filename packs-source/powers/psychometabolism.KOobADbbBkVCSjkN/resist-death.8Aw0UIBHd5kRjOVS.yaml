      <p>The manifester combines life force and psionic energy into a shield
      that protects the target from negative energy attacks. This power prevents
      energy drain and any negative energy effects, including channeled energy.
      Once the power has prevented (or helped prevent) one effect, the power
      dissipates. When manifested the power deals 2 points of non-lethal damage
      to the target. The damage may be healed normally. The subject gains +4
      moral bonus against death spells and magical/psionic death effects even if
      a save to negate such effects is not normally allowed.

      </p>

      <p>This power does not remove negative levels that the target has already
      gained, but it does remove penalties from negative levels for the duration
      of the power.

      </p>

      <p>Resist death does not protect against other sorts of attacks, even if
      those attacks might be lethal.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every additional 2 points spent, the
      power prevents 1 additional effect.
