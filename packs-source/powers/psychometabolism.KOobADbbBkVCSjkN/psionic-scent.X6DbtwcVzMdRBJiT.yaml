      <p>You gain an enhanced sense of smell, equivalent to the scent ability of
      some monsters. This ability allows you to detect approaching enemies,
      sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell. With the scent
      ability, you can identify familiar odors just as humanoids do familiar
      sights.

      </p>

      <p>You can detect opponents within 30 feet by sense of smell. If the
      opponent is upwind, the range increases to 60 feet; if downwind, it drops
      to 15 feet. Strong scents, such as smoke or rotting garbage, can be
      detected at twice the ranges noted above. Overpowering scents, such as
      skunk musk or troglodyte stench, can be detected at triple normal range.

      </p>

      <p>When you detect a scent, the exact location of the source is not
      revealed—only its presence somewhere within range. You can take a move
      action to note the direction of the scent. Whenever you come within 5 feet
      of the source, you pinpoint the source's location.

      </p>

      <p>You can follow tracks by smell, making a Survival check to find or
      follow a track. The typical DC for a fresh trail is 10 (no matter what
      kind of surface holds the scent). This DC increases or decreases depending
      on how strong the quarry's odor is, the number of creatures, and the age
      of the trail. For each hour that the trail is cold, the DC increases by 2.
      If you are tracking with psionic scent, you ignore the effects of surface
      conditions and poor visibility.
