    value: >-
      <p>You cleanse the subject's body of unhealthy influences and relieve
      1d2+1 rounds' worth of debilitating conditions - dazed, confused,
      nauseated, shaken, and/or stunned. The subject gains instant relief if she
      is dazed, confused, nauseated, shaken, and/or stunned. If the duration of
      the debilitating condition is longer than the relief provided by this
      power, the subject can either, at your choice, remain affected by the
      debilitating condition, but for a reduced time, or gain 1d2+1 rounds
      unaffected by the condition. So, if the subject is dazed for 10 rounds,
      using this power can either grant them 1d2+1 rounds not being dazed or
      shorten that period by 1d2+1 rounds. You could manifest this power again
      to relieve the additional rounds of the specified debilitating conditions.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> This power can be augmented in one or more of
      the following ways.

      </p><ol><li>For every 2 additional power points you spend, the number of
      rounds of relief extends by 1.</li><li>If you spend 8 additional power
      points, you can restore a petrified creature back to its normal state,
      although the subject must make a successful DC 15 Fortitude save to
      survive the process. Any petrified creature, regardless of size, can be
      restored.</li></ol>
