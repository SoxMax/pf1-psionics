      <p>This power causes instant diminution, halving your height, length, and
      width and dividing your weight by 8. This decrease changes your size
      category to the next smaller one. You gain a +2 size bonus to Dexterity, a
      –2 size penalty to Strength (to a minimum of 1), a +1 size bonus on attack
      rolls and AC due to your reduced size.

      </p>

      <p>If your new size is Tiny, you have a space of 2 1/2 feet and a natural
      reach of 0 feet (meaning that you must enter an opponent's square to
      attack). If your new size is Diminutive, you have a space of 1 foot and a
      natural reach of 0 feet. If your size decreases to Medium, you have a
      space of 5 feet and a natural reach of 5 feet. This power doesn't change
      your speed.

      </p>

      <p>All your equipment, worn or carried, is similarly reduced by the power.
      Melee and projectile weapons deal less damage. Other psionic or magical
      properties are not affected by this power. Any affected item that leaves
      your possession (including a projectile or thrown weapon) instantly
      returns to its normal size. This means that thrown weapons deal their
      normal damage (projectiles deal damage based on the size of the weapon
      that fired them). Multiple effects that reduce size do not stack, which
      means (among other things) that you can't use a second manifestation of
      this power to further reduce yourself.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> You can augment this power in one or more of
      the following ways.

      </p><ol><li>If you spend 6 additional power points, this power decreases
      your size by two size categories. You gain a +4 size bonus to Dexterity, a
      –4 size penalty to Strength (to a minimum effective Strength score of 1),
      a +2 size bonus on attack rolls, and a +2 size bonus to Armor Class due to
      your reduced size.</li><li>If you spend 6 additional power points, you can
      manifest this power as a swift action instead of a standard
      action.</li><li>If you spend 2 additional power points, this power's
      duration is 10 minutes per level rather than 1 minute per level.</li></ol>
