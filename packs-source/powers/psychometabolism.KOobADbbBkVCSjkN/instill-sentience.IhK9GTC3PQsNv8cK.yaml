    value: >-
      <p>You awaken the mind of something that once had none using a specific
      ritual and previously prepared crystals that are consumed in the ritual
      (cost of 5000 gp). If you manifest this power as an athanatism power, you
      infuse the target with the soul of a previously dead, but intelligent,
      creature. The target gains the psionic subtype and a limited form of
      telepathy, allowing it to communicate wordlessly with&#160;a willing
      creature within 30 ft.

      </p>

      <p>You have no special empathy or connection with a creature you awaken,
      although it is friendly and will often help you with specific tasks or
      endeavors if you communicate your desires to it. Creatures previously
      under another creature’s control, either as shield guardians or a golem
      crafter’s creations, break all connections with that creature.

      </p>

      <p>An awakened plant has characteristics as if it were an animated object
      of its size, except that it gains the plant type and its Intelligence,
      Wisdom, and Charisma scores are each 3d6. An awakened plant gains the
      ability to move its limbs, roots, vines, creepers, and so forth, and it
      has senses similar to a human’s, but generally can’t speak beyond its
      telepathic abilities.

      </p>

      <p>For constructs and animals, roll 3d6 to determine the Intelligence
      score of the awakened creature, and increase its Charisma score by 2d6.

      </p>

      <p>The creature gains the (augmented) subtype and it gains feats and skill
      points according to its new Intelligence score, and the skill points are
      assigned appropriately, as determined by the GM. An awakened creature
      speaks one language plus one additional language per point of Intelligence
      bonus (if any). Its alignment is determined by the GM. Such a creature
      cannot serve as the familiar, animal companion, mount or other servant of
      another creature unless the GM decides that it is appropriate.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment: </strong>This power may be augmented in one or more of
      the following ways.

      </p><ul><li>If you spend 2 additional power points, you can awaken vermin
      or oozes too.</li><li>If you spend 2 additional power points, and manifest
      this power as an athanatism power, you can awaken mindless undead too,
      binding a different spirit to its animated husk.</li></ul>
