    value: >-
      <p>You cause the touched subject's flesh to ripple, grow together, and
      fuse into a nearly seamless whole. The subject is forced into a fetal
      position (if humanoid), with only the vaguest outline of its folded arms
      and legs visible below the all-encompassing wave of flesh. The subject
      retains the ability to breathe, eat, and excrete, but may lose the use of
      its senses (see below). If the sudden transformation would prove fatal to
      the creature (such as fusing a swimming airbreathing subject, or a flying
      subject), the subject gets a +4 bonus on the save. Unless it loses the use
      of its senses (see below), the creature can still perform purely mental
      actions, such as manifesting powers.

      </p>

      <p>If the target fails its Fortitude save to avoid the power's effect, the
      subject must immediately attempt a second Fortitude save. If this second
      save is failed, the creature's eyes and ears fuse over, effectively
      blinding and deafening it. Moreover, it loses its extraordinary,
      supernatural, and spell-like abilities, as well as its ability to manifest
      powers (if any), and is generally in sorry shape.

      </p>

      <p>Incorporeal or gaseous creatures and creatures not composed of flesh
      are immune to fuse flesh, and a shapechanger can revert to its unfused
      form as a standard action.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every 2 additional power points you
      spend, this power's save DC increases by 1.
