      <p>You subtly shift your features and voice, making you less noticeable
      and granting you a +10 circumstance bonus to Disguise checks, although you
      may not attempt to appear as a certain individual or another race.

      </p>

      <p>This is a minor physical transformation, not an illusion, and as such
      fools touch as well as sight.

      </p>

      <p>You may alter any skin or facial features to be anything normally
      possible for the race you appear as. Birthmarks, moles, tattoos,
      piercings, and other distinguishing features are not visible unless you
      specifically will it. Psionic tattoos may still be tapped while hidden.

      </p>

      <p>At any point during the power's duration, you may concentrate as a
      standard action to change your appearance again, including to resemble
      yourself.

      </p>

      <p>Your clothing and gear are not changed.

      </p>

      to disguise yourself as particular individuals.</li><li>If you spend 2
      additional power points, you may alter your smell to blend in with
      creatures using the scent ability or who identify individuals by
      pheromones or other chemical senses.</li></ol>
