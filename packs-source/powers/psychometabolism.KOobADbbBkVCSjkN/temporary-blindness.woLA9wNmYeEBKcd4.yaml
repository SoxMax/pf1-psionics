      <p>You temporarily disconnect the body's sight from whatever processes the
      images in them, causing them to suffer temporary blindness. The target
      must make a Fortitude save or become blinded. The target can make a new
      save at the end of each round to remove the blindness.

      the following ways.

      to 1 minute per level. The target gets to make a new save every minute
      instead of every round.</li><li>If you spend 4 additional power points,
      the duration extends to 1 day per level. The target gets to make a new
      save every day instead of every round.</li><li>If you spend 4 additional
      power points, the target does not gain any additional saves if they fail
      the first.</li><li>If you spend 4 additional power points, you can target
      one target per manifester level.</li><li>If you spend 6 additional power
      points, the duration becomes Permanent instead of 1 round/lvl.</li></ol>

      increase the DC by +1.
