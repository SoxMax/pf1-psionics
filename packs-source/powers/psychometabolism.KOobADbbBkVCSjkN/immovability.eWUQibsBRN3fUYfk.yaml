      <p>You are almost impossible to move. Your weight does not vary; instead,
      you mentally attach yourself to the underlying fabric of the plane. Thus,
      you could conceivably anchor yourself in midair. Any creature attempting
      to physically move you must succeed on an opposed Strength check, and you
      gain a +20 bonus on the check. You can't voluntarily move to a new
      location unless you stop concentrating, which ends the power.

      </p>

      <p>You cannot apply your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class; however, your
      anchored body gains damage reduction 15/–.

      </p>

      <p>You cannot make physical attacks or perform any other large-scale
      movements (you can make smallscale movements, such as breathing, turning
      your head, moving your eyes, talking, and so on). Powers with the
      teleportation descriptor, or any telekinetic effect, manifested on you
      automatically fail.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> If you spend 8 additional power points, you
      can manifest this power as an immediate action.
