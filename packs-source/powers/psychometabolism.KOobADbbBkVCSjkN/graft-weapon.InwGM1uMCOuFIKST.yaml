      <p>You attach any melee weapon you can use in one hand— mundane, psionic,
      or magical—onto the end of one of your arms. The weapon becomes a natural
      extension of your arm, and that hand blends seamlessly into the shaft,
      hilt, or head of the weapon. Now that the weapon and you are one, you gain
      a +1 competence bonus on all attack and damage rolls while using the
      weapon.

      </p>

      <p>The grafted weapon is considered both a standard weapon and a natural
      weapon for the purpose of effects that distinguish between either weapon
      type. For instance, the grafted weapon is treated as a natural weapon for
      the purpose of delivering a touch attack with a power in conjunction with
      the weapon attack. As with any power (or spell) melee touch attack made in
      conjunction with a natural weapon attack, the touch attack effect is not
      delivered unless the natural weapon strikes normally; on a failed attack,
      the touch power (or spell) is wasted.

      </p>

      <p>For a creature under the effect of the claws of the beast power,
      grafting a weapon means that attacks with this hand deal the base damage
      of the weapon, instead of the claw upon which the creature normally
      relies.

      </p>

      <p>While your hand is grafted to a weapon, you lose the use of that hand
      and take a –2 penalty on all skill checks requiring the use of hands.
      Powers that temporarily polymorph or metamorph you can ignore the grafted
      weapon or alter it normally, at your discretion. If the weapon takes
      damage, you take damage as well. If you are healed, so is your grafted
      weapon. If your weapon is destroyed, you permanently lose 2 points of
      Constitution; the ability drain persists until you can restore your
      natural anatomy (by means of regenerate or a similar effect).

      </p>

      <p>When this power's duration expires, the grafted weapon falls to the
      ground and your hand returns.
