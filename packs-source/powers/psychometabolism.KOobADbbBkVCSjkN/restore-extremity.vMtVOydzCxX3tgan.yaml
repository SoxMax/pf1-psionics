  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You restore a severed extremity to a creature that has lost a digit,
      hand, arm, leg, or even its head. This power does not restore life, but it
      returns a lost extremity to a living or dead creature if the creature is
      otherwise mostly intact. The original extremity need not be present when
      this power is manifested; a new extremity is created by the power. If a
      head is restored to a body, the original head (if not already destroyed)
      loses all spark of identity, and can be considered dead tissue.
