    value: >-
      <p>When death is about to claim you because of a lethal attack of any
      sort, you instead enter a state of suspended animation. While fatality is
      deferred, you do not age, breathe, grow hungry, sleep, or regain power
      points. You are unaware of your surroundings and cannot use subconscious
      powers. Outside forces can damage your body, but as long as your head
      remains attached to your torso and your brain remains intact, the physical
      damage can be healed. A coup de'grace still forces you to make a Fortitude
      save or die.

      </p>

      <p>You can manifest this power quickly enough to avoid complete
      destruction if you are unexpectedly affected by a lethal melee or ranged
      attack or effect. You cannot manifest this power if you are unconscious.

      </p>

      <p>You remain in a state of deferred fatality until some third party
      provides you with magical or psionic healing in the amount equal to 10
      points + the amount of damage your body originally (and subsequently)
      sustained which dropped you into this deferred state. When so cured, you
      become conscious, possess 1 hp, 1 power point, and sustain 1d4+1 points of
      temporary ability damage on each of your six ability scores. (If this
      brings your Constitution score to 0, you die normally.)
