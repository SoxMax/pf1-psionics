    value: >-
      <p>You convert large portions of your target's blood to a caustic fluid,
      wracking them with pain and misery. The target takes 2d6 acid damage at
      the start of their turn and becomes fatigued until the beginning of their
      text turn. A successful Fortitude save halves the damage and negates the
      fatigued condition. If the target is suffering bleed damage at the
      beginning of its turn, adjacent creatures must succeed at a Reflex save or
      suffer the damage dealt by this power as well.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> You may augment this power in the following
      ways:

      </p><ul><li>For every 2 power points you spend, its damage increases by
      one die (d6).</li><li>If you spend an additional 4 power points, victims
      that fail their saving throws also become nauseated for 1 round.</li></ul>

      <p>In addition, for every 2 power points spent to achieve either of these
      results, increase the save DC of this power by 1.
