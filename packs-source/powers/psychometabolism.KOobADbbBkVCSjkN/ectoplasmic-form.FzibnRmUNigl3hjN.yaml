      <p>You and all your gear become a partially translucent mass of rippling
      ectoplasm that generally conforms to your normal shape. You gain damage
      reduction 10/psionics, and you gain immunity to poison and critical hits.
      Your material armor becomes meaningless, although your size, Dexterity,
      deflection bonuses, and armor bonuses from force effects (such as those
      gained by inertial armor) still apply to your Armor Class.

      </p>

      <p>You can manifest powers while in ectoplasmic form, but you must make a
      concentration check (DC 20 + power level) for each power you attempt to
      manifest.

      </p>

      <p>You cannot physically attack, you lose supernatural abilities (if any),
      and you can't speak while in ectoplasmic form. You can't run, but you can
      fly at a speed of 20 feet (perfect). You can pass through small holes or
      narrow openings, even mere cracks, with all you were wearing or holding in
      your hands. You are subject to the effects of wind, and you can't enter
      water or other liquid. You also can't manipulate objects or activate
      items, even those carried along with you. Continuously active items remain
      active, though in some cases their effects may be moot (such as items that
      provide armor or natural armor bonuses).
