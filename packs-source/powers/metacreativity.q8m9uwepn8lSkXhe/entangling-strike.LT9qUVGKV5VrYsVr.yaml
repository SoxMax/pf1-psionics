      <p>The next successful melee attack you make this turn entangles the
      target until the end of its next turn.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Trigger:</strong> If your attack was successful and the target
      tries to make a concentration check before the end of its next turn, you
      can immediately expend your psionic focus to deal 2d6 points of damage to
      it. The damage dealt causes the standard penalty to that concentration
      check.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> If you spend 6 additional power points, you
      can instead manifest this power upon making a successful melee attack and
      have the effects of this power instead apply to that attack. Doing so
      still uses your swift action for the round.
