    value: >-
      <p>You create a small, finite demiplane. You must be on the Astral or
      Ethereal Plane or on a plane that has access to one of those planes (such
      as the Material Plane) to manifest this power. When you manifest the
      power, you decide whether the demiplane is within the Astral or the
      Ethereal Plane. It is filled with air or water (decided by you). The plane
      is generally flat and featureless, such as an earth, stone, water, or wood
      floor. The "walls" and "ceiling" of the plane may appear like solid earth,
      stone, wood, or water, or they may end in mist, a featureless void, or a
      similar unreal-looking border. The plane's environmental conditions are
      those of a temperate spring day on the Material Plane. You determine the
      plane's light level (bright, normal, dim, or darkness), which affects the
      entire plane.

      </p>

      <p>There are no native creatures or plants on this plane, though you may
      bring some there (if the plane's light is bright or normal, it counts as
      sunlight for growing plants). The environment of the plane counts as
      normal terrain for the purpose of effects that target earth, stone, wood,
      and so on. For example, you could use foxhole to create a small trench or
      modify matter to create a stone building.

      </p>

      <p>When you finish manifesting this power, you may bring yourself and up
      to seven other creatures to the plane automatically by joining hands in a
      circle. The demiplane is another plane of existence, and therefore is
      outside the range of any power or ability that cannot affect or reach
      other planes. Creatures can only enter the plane by the use of planar
      travel powers such as astral caravan or planar travel. You are considered
      "very familiar" with your entire demiplane.

      </p>

      <p>As a standard action, you may eject a creature from your demiplane. The
      creature may resist with a Will saving throw. An ejected creature goes to
      the closest plane to your demiplane (usually the Astral Plane or the
      Ethereal Plane, but if you manifest this power on the Material Plane, the
      creature is sent to the Material Plane). When the power ends, the plane
      dissolves, and all creatures in the plane are ejected in this manner with
      no saving throw. The plane cannot be dispelled, but a creature on the
      plane can destroy it by using bend reality, reality revision, or unravel
      psionics and making a successful dispel check.

      </p>

      <p>If you are within the demiplane, you can add to its area by manifesting
      the power again. Alternatively, you may manifest this power again to reset
      the duration of an existing area to that of your latest manifesting. If
      the duration on one area of the demiplane ends and other parts remain,
      creatures in the expiring area are shunted to remaining areas. If a
      collapsing portion of the demiplane would leave one section cut off from
      other sections of the demiplane (for example, if there were three areas
      connected in a straight line and the center part expired), the stranded
      sections count as separate demiplanes under your control. You may
      reconnect these stranded sections by manifesting the power again to create
      a linked area between the two.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> This power may be augmented in one or more of
      the following ways.

      </p><ol><li>By spending 4 additional power points, instead of increasing
      the size of an existing demiplane, you may add or remove any planar trait
      available via the spell create demiplane to a demiplane you created via
      genesis. If you spend 6PP, you may choose any trait available via create
      demiplane, greater. Either of these augments changes this power's duration
      to Instantaneous.</li><li>By spending two additional power points and
      doubling the manifestation time, the maximum size increases to 10 10-ft.
      cubes per level.</li><li>By spending 4 additional power points and
      quadrupling the manifestation time, the maximum size increases to 20
      10-ft. cubes per level.</li><li>By spending 2 additional power points and
      channelling the power through specially-treated crystals similar to
      cognizance crystals that cost 20,000gp, the duration of this power becomes
      Permanent. These crystals are consumed during the manifestation process,
      becoming an infinitely fine lattice of psionic energy that roots the plane
      to the underlying fabric of its neighboring plane(s).</li></ol>
