    value: >-
      <p>The arrow you have just fired arcs towards its target then abruptly
      reality is rewritten and multiple arrows spawn in its place. If you
      manifest <em>spray </em>just after taking a shot with a ranged weapon (but
      not thrown weapon), just before striking its target, your projectile
      splits into as many as three identical projectiles, able to strike
      different targets. You may designate two targets adjacent to your original
      target, and the two twin projectiles will be directed at them. You make a
      single attack roll and modify that roll for each target as appropriate for
      cover, concealment and similar effects.

      </p>

      <p>Each duplicate projectile created by <em>spray </em>is identical to the
      original, so any effects or abilities being delivered by that projectile
      are similarly duplicated.

      </p>

      <p>In the case of a critical threat on the single attack roll, you must
      roll separate confirmation rolls per target. In the case of a critical
      fumble (if playing with fumble optional rules), only roll one
      confirmation.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment: </strong>For every four additional power points you
      spend, you may add one more duplicate projectile.
