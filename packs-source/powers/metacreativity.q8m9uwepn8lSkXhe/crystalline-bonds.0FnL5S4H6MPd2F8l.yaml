      <p>You create rope-like coils of crystal that encircle your foe, gagging
      and immobilizing him, dealing 3d6 points of damage and 1d6 points of
      damage every round thereafter, as the crystal tightens against the target.

      </p>

      <p>A creature caught by the crystal can attempt purely mental actions, but
      must make a concentration check (DC 20 + half the continuous damage dealt)
      to manifest powers. The creature can attempt to break free by spending 1
      round and making a DC 20 Strength or Escape Artist check. The bond can
      alternatively be cut to break the target free. The crystal has AC 5,
      hardness 12, and 30 hit points.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> This power can be augmented in one or more of
      the following ways.

      </p><ol><li>For every 2 additional power points spent, this power can
      affect a target of one size category larger.</li><li>For every 2
      additional power points spent, the continuous damage increases by 1d6
      points of damage.</li></ol>

      <p>In addition, for every 2 additional power points spent on either of the
      above options, the power's save DC and the DCs to break free increase by
      1.
