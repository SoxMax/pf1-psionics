      <p>You transform your body into living iron, which grants you several
      powerful resistances and abilities. You gain damage reduction
      15/adamantine. You are immune to blindness, critical hits, ability score
      damage, deafness, disease, drowning, electricity, poison, stunning, and
      all powers or attacks that affect your physiology or respiration, because
      you have no physiology or respiration while this power is in effect. You
      take only half damage from acid and fire. However, you also become
      vulnerable to all special attacks that affect iron golems.

      </p>

      <p>You gain a +6 enhancement bonus to your Strength score, but you take a
      –6 penalty to Dexterity as well (to a minimum Dexterity score of 1), and
      your speed is reduced to half normal. You have an arcane spell failure
      chance of 35% and a –6 armor check penalty, just as if you were clad in
      full plate armor. You cannot drink (and thus can't use potions) or play
      wind instruments.

      </p>

      <p>Your unarmed attack deals damage equal to a club sized for you (1d4 for
      Small characters or 1d6 for Medium characters), and you are considered
      armed when making unarmed attacks.

      </p>

      <p>Your weight increases by a factor of 10, causing you to sink in water
      like a stone. However, you could survive the lack of air at the bottom of
      the ocean—at least until the duration expires.
