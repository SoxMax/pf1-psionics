  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You collapse a bit of time from the continuum, forming a 1-ounce dollop
      of thick, gooey material called quintessence. This substance shimmers like
      a silver mirror when viewed from some angles but is transparent from other
      viewpoints. You can smooth a dollop of quintessence around any extremely
      small object.

      </p>

      <p>Objects sealed within quintessence are protected from the effects of
      time; in practical terms, they enter a state of stasis. Living flesh with
      only partial contact with quintessence is also partially pulled out of the
      time stream (the manifester is immune to this effect). This disruption
      deals 1 point of damage per round beginning 10 rounds after partial
      contact occurs.

      </p>

      <p>Quintessence can be manually scraped away from a protected object,
      freeing it to rejoin the time stream. When you do this, there is a 75%
      chance that the quintessence evaporates back into the continuum.
      Otherwise, it coalesces again into a 1-inch-diameter bead, available for
      later use.

      </p>

      <p>Large quantities of quintessence could theoretically be gathered to
      preserve large items or structures (or even a complete living creature; if
      completely immersed, a living creature would not take the damage
      associated with partial contact). However, psionic characters and
      creatures are generally loath to do so because accumulations of
      quintessence weighing 1 pound or more hinder psionic activity within a
      5-foot radius of the accumulation: Powers require twice as many power
      points to manifest, unless the manifester makes a successful Will save
      each time he or she attempts to manifest a power. Also in these
      circumstances, manifesting a psi-like ability that is usable at will is a
      full-round action rather than a standard action.
