    value: >-
      <p>You weave a quasi-real membrane around yourself. You remain visible
      within the translucent, amorphous enclosure. This distortion grants you
      concealment (opponents have a 20% miss chance), thanks to the rippling
      membrane encasing your form. You can pick up or drop objects, easily
      reaching through the film. Anything you hold is enveloped by the amorpha.
      Likewise, you can engage in melee, make ranged attacks, and manifest
      powers without hindrance.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> If you spend 4 additional power points, the
      membrane can spread and affect one creature adjacent to you. If the
      creature moves away from you, it loses the protection.
