      <p>You fashion an ephemeral, many-legged mass of pseudoliving ectoplasm
      called an ectoplasmic shambler. You can direct the shambler as a free
      action. It has a speed of 10 feet. It can completely surround objects (and
      opponents) over which it is manifested or onto which it moves, because it
      has the consistency of thick mist. The vision of those within the shambler
      is limited to 5 feet, and manifesting powers (or casting spells) within
      the shambler is difficult due to the constant turbulence felt by those
      caught in the shambler's form. Vision through the shambler is similarly
      impaired for those outside the shamble.

      </p>

      <p>Creatures enveloped by the shambler, regardless of Armor Class, take 1
      point of damage for every two manifester levels you have in each round
      they become enveloped in or remain within the roiling turbulence of the
      shambler. Anyone trying to manifest a power must make a concentration
      check (DC 15 + power's or spell's level) to successfully manifest a power
      or cast a spell inside the shambler.

      </p>

      <p>A wind stronger than 20 miles per hour that blows against the shambler
      reduces its speed to 0 feet during the first round, and in subsequent
      rounds moves it in the direction of the wind at a speed of 5 feet. A wind
      stronger than 20 miles per hour that blows in the direction the shambler
      travels increases its speed to 15 feet.
