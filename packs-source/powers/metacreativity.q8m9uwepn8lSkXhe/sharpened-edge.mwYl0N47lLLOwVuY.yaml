        value: >-
          One weapon or fifty projectiles, all of which must be in contact with
          each other at the time of manifestation
  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You psionically make a weapon keen, improving its ability to deal
      telling blows. This doubles the threat range of the weapon. A threat range
      of 20 becomes 19–20, a threat range of 19–20 becomes 17–20, and a threat
      range of 18– 20 becomes 15–20. The power can be manifested only on
      piercing or slashing weapons. If used on arrows or crossbow bolts, the
      effect on a particular projectile ends after one use, whether or not the
      missile strikes its intended target. Treat shuriken as arrows, rather than
      as thrown weapons, for the purpose of this power.

      </p>

      <p>Multiple effects that increase a weapon's threat range (such as the
      keen special weapon property and the Improved Critical feat) don't stack.
      You can't manifest this power on a natural weapon, such as a claw.
