      <p>You draw forth a glob of ectoplasmic goo from the Astral Plane and
      immediately throw it as a ranged touch attack at any creature in range. On
      a successful hit, the subject is covered in goo and becomes entangled. The
      goo evaporates at the end of the power's duration. Entangled creatures can
      attempt to break free as a move action, making a Strength or Escape Artist
      check. The DC for this check is equal to 11 + the manifester's key ability
      modifier.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every 2 additional power points you
      spend, this power can affect a target one size category larger and the DC
      to break free increases by 1.
