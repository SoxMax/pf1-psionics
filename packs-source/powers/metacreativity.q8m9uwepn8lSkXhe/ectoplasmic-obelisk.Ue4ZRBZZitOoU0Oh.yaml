      <p>Expanding from a mid-air spec of colorful ectoplasm, a massive statue
      forms in space where you designate it, blocking travel and sight. When you
      manifest this power, you must specify an unoccupied square, which then
      becomes filled by a simple ectoplasmic statue of your design. This statue
      impedes movement as would one of the same size carved out of stone. An
      ectoplasmic obelisk has hardness 10 and 30 hit points. The created obelisk
      is newly created and thus has not yet made any impression in the floor
      below it, so it may be possible to push it one square with a DC 15
      Strength check.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment: </strong>You may augment this power in one or more of
      the following ways.

      </p><ul><li>For every additional power point you spend on this power, the
      hardness of the obelisk is increased by 1 and its hit points increase by
      2. Additionally, the weight of the obelisk increases, adding 1 to the
      Strength DC required to push it.</li><li>By spending an additional 6 power
      points, you may make an ectoplasmic obelisk up to one 10-ft. square in
      size.</li><li>By spending an additional 10 power points, the duration of
      this power becomes Permanent.</li></ul>
