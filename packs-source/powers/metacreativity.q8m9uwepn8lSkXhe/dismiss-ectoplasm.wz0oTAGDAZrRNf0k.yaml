      <p>You dismiss creatures, objects, or effects composed of ectoplasm, such
      as astral constructs or the ectoplasmic cocoon power, or that were
      formerly composed of ectoplasm, such as items created by metacreativity
      (creation) powers.

      </p>

      <p>An ectoplasmic creature that fails its Will saving throw dissipates
      into so much constituent ectoplasm, which evaporates immediately.

      </p>

      <p>A creature under the effect of the ectoplasmic form power that fails
      its saving throw is either destroyed out right or physically shifted to a
      random location on the Astral Plane (50% chance for either result).

      </p>

      <p>Other ongoing powers that create ectoplasmic objects or effects, such
      as ectoplasmic cocoon, are dismissed if you succeed on a manifester level
      check (1d20 + your manifester level, maximum +10) against a DC of 11 + the
      power's manifester level.
