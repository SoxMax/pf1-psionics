      <p>This power creates one 1st-level astral construct of solidified
      ectoplasm that attacks your enemies. It appears where you designate and
      acts immediately, on your turn. It attacks your opponents to the best of
      its ability. As a free action, you can mentally direct it not to attack,
      to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions. The astral
      construct acts normally on the last round of the power's duration and
      dissipates at the end of its turn.

      </p>

      <p>Astral constructs are not summoned; they are created on the plane you
      inhabit (using ectoplasm drawn from the Astral Plane). Thus, they are not
      subject to effects that hedge out or otherwise affect outsiders; they are
      constructs, not outsiders.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every 2 additional power points you
      spend, the level of the astral construct increases by one.
