      <p>The stench of oils wafts around you, then the target of your ire finds
      themselves doused in a sticky flammable jelly that reeks of fiery doom.
      When you manifest <em>accelerant</em>, one creature or object becomes
      coated by a layer of fluid that they cannot easily remove. The target may
      immerse their entire body in a solvent to remove the oily slick, but
      ordinary water does not dissolve the fuel you have created.

      </p>

      <p>Once so coated, the target is vulnerable to any source of flame,
      psionic or mundane. Mere contact with fire ignites the gel, forcing the
      subject to make a Reflex save to avoid catching on fire. On a failed
      saving throw, the target takes 1d6 points of fire damage. Each round
      thereafter, the target must make another Reflex save at the same DC to
      extinguish the flames, with failure resulting in an additional 1d6 points
      of fire damage. The target of this power may automatically extinguish (but
      not remove) the burning jelly by jumping into enough water to douse
      themselves. If insufficient water is available, the target may roll on the
      ground or smother the fire with cloaks or similar to make another save
      with a +4 bonus. This fire does not cause clothes or equipment to burn.

      </p>

      <p>The flammable jelly remains present even when not burning and can be
      reignited by fresh exposure to a fire source. Once the duration of this
      power expires, the fuel vanishes. If the target is on fire when
      <em>accelerant </em>ends, they remain burning until they succeed at
      putting the fire out.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment: </strong>For every additional two power points you
      spend, the damage dealt by this power increases by 1d6 and the saving
      throw DC increases by 1.
