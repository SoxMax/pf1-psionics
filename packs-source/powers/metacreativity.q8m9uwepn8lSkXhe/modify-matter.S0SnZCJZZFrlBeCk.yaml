      <p>You convert material of one sort into a product that is of the same
      material. Creatures or psionic items cannot be created or transmuted by
      this effect. The quality of items made by this power is commensurate with
      the quality of material used as the basis for the new fabrication. If you
      work with a mineral, the target is reduced to 1 cubic foot per level
      instead of 10 cubic feet.

      </p>

      <p>You must make an appropriate Craft check to fabricate articles
      requiring a high degree of craftsmanship.

      </p>

      <p>Manifesting requires 1 round per 10 cubic feet of material to be
      affected by the power. This power may not be used on attended items.
