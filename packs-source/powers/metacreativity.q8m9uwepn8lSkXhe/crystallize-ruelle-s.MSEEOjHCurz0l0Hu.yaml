    value: >-
      <p>You seed the subject's flesh with supersaturated crystal. In the blink
      of an eye, the subject's form seems to freeze over, as its flesh and
      fluids are instantly crystallized. Following the application of this
      power, the subject appears lifeless. In fact, it is not dead (though no
      life can be detected with powers or spells that detect such).

      </p>

      <p>This power has a chance of being dispelled only by a manifester of a
      higher level than you when you manifested this power. When the power is
      dispelled, crystal melts back into flesh, and the subject is in exactly
      the state he was prior to being affected by crystallize.
