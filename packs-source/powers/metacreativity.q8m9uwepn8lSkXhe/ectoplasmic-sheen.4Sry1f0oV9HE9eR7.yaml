      <p>You draw forth ectoplasm in an area, causing the surface to become
      slick. Any creature in the area when the power is manifested must make a
      successful Reflex save or fall. A creature can walk within or through the
      area of ectoplasm at half normal speed with a DC 10 Acrobatics check.
      Failure means it can't move that round (and must then make a Reflex save
      or fall), while failure by 5 or more means it falls (see the Acrobatics
      skill for details). Creatures that do not move on their turn do not need
      to make this check and are not considered flat-footed.

      </p>

      <p>The power can also be used to create a greasy coating on an item.
      Material objects not in use are always affected by this power, while an
      object wielded or employed by a creature requires its bearer to make a
      Reflex saving throw to avoid the effect. If the initial saving throw
      fails, the creature immediately drops the item. A saving throw must be
      made in each round that the creature attempts to pick up or use the
      affected item. A creature wearing affected armor or clothing gains a +10
      circumstance bonus on Escape Artist checks and combat maneuver checks made
      to escape a grapple, and to their CMD to avoid being grappled.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> If you spend 6 additional power points, each
      target that fails a Reflex save to remain standing and falls must first
      make a Strength check (with the same DC as the Reflex save) to stand.

      </p>

      <p>In addition, for every two additional power points you spend augmenting
      this power, the power's save DC increases by 1.
