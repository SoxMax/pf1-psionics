    value: >-
      <p>This power allows the manifester to cause the power of the
      already-unstable animus within a target to lose containment and become
      explosive within the target's body. When manifesting this power, the
      manifester makes a touch attack against the target and he may cause 1d4
      points of animus in the target to erupt within them (consuming the point
      of animus), causing 5 points of damage per animus point consumed with this
      ability. The target of this ability may make a Fortitude save to negate
      the damage while they release the dangerous animus from their body, but
      the animus targeted by this power is consumed. If the target does not
      possess animus, this power has no effct.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment: </strong>If you spend an additional 2 power points
      points, you may alter the range of this power to close range (25 feet + 5
      feet per two manifester levels) and make the attack as a ranged touch
      attack.

      </p>

      <p>If you spend an additional 2 power points, you may consume and explode
      an additional 1d4 points of animus within the target.
