    value: >-
      <p>Your arrows explode on impact, ejecting shards of ectoplasmic energy
      when they hit. Each attack you make with a ranged or thrown weapon this
      round causes 3d6 points of splash damage to the squares adjacent to your
      target if you hit. The damage dealt is piercing damage and it is treated
      as if it were of the same material as your ammunition. Thusly an
      alchemical silver arrow that strikes your target will deal splash damage
      that bypasses DR/silver.

      </p>

      <p>If you arrows miss your target, they do not deal any splash damage.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every two additional power points you
      spend, the splash damage dealt increases by 1d6.
