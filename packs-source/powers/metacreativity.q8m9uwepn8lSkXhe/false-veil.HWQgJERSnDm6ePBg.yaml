      <p>You draw upon the proto-magics of akasha to weave an extremely minor <a
      href="/wiki/Veil" title="Veil">veil</a> on the target. This veil doesn't
      do anything in particular, but can be formed on any open chakra and can
      look like whatever the caster desires (including other appropriate veils).
      It can be readily identified as a veil as normal, but noticing that it
      isn't a fully operational one takes an appropriate Knowledge check (DC
      25). This veil can be invested with essence by the person it is formed on,
      just like any other. Essence invested this way makes the veil appear more
      solid, with much more dramatic energies swirling, sparking, or showering
      from it. This increases the DC to identify that it is not functional by +2
      per point of essence invested. It cannot be bound.

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every 2 additional power points you
      spend, increase the range of this power by one category (touch to close,
      close to medium, and medium to long).
