    value: >-
      <p>A tiny ectoplasmic crystal emanates from your outstretched hand and
      rapidly expands to a 2-foot-diameter ball of crystal as it speeds toward
      the location you designate. You can choose to aim this crystal at a single
      target or at a specific point in space (a grid intersection).

      </p>

      <p>If you aim the crystal at a single target, you must make a ranged touch
      attack to strike the target. Any creature or object struck by the ball of
      crystal takes 5d4 points of bludgeoning damage.

      </p>

      <p>Whether the crystal hits its target, misses, or was aimed at a point in
      space, it explodes upon arrival at the location you designated. Anyone
      within 20 feet of the explosion takes 9d4 points of slashing damage from
      the thousands of crystal shards that spray forth, although the damage is
      halved on a successful Reflex save.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every additional power point you spend,
      this power's damage from the explosion of the crystal increases by 1d4
      points.
