          hemisphere with a radius of up to 1 ft./level
  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You fashion a roiling wall of ectoplasm, imbuing it with solidity. The
      wall cannot move once it is formed. It is 1 inch thick per four manifester
      levels and occupies up to one 5-foot square per level. Each 5-foot square
      of the wall has 10 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 5. A
      section of the wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature
      tries to break through the wall, the DC for the Strength check is 15 + 2
      per inch of thickness.

      </p>

      <p>The wall of ectoplasm is susceptible to dispel psionics, but it gains a
      +4 bonus on any check to determine whether the wall is negated. Spells,
      powers, and breath weapons cannot pass through the wall in either
      direction (though they could damage it). It blocks ethereal creatures as
      well as material creatures (though ethereal creatures can usually get
      around the wall by floating under or over it through material floors and
      ceilings). The wall is opaque, so neither vision nor gaze attacks operate
      through it. The wall does not block psychoportive travel, such as that
      provided by the psychoport power.

      </p>

      <p>You can form the wall into a flat plane whose area is up to one 10-foot
      square per level or into a sphere or hemisphere with a radius of up to 1
      foot per level.

      </p>

      <p>The wall of ectoplasm must be continuous and unbroken when manifested.
      If its surface is interrupted by any object or creature, the power fails.
