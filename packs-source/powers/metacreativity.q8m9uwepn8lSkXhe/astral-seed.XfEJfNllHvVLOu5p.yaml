      <p>This power weaves strands of astral ectoplasm into a crystal containing
      the seed of your living mind (hardness 1 and 1 hit point). You can have
      only one astral seed in existence at any one time. Until such time as you
      perish, the astral seed (also called the storage crystal) is utterly
      inert. If you are slain at some later date, your soul transfers into the
      storage crystal, which begins to dimly glow.

      </p>

      <p>Upon transference, your physical remains (should they still exist)
      become inert matter and cannot thereafter be restored to life. The
      transfer from the slain body to the astral seed works over any distance,
      physical or extradimensional.

      </p>

      <p>Once your body's physical demise activates the storage crystal, you
      have the abilities of a psicrystal of the appropriate level, full hit
      points, plus all the powers you knew, the maximum power points you
      possessed when astral seed was manifested, and the current number of power
      points you had prior to the transfer into the crystal. Should this be
      higher than the maximum power points when the power was manifested, you
      have the lower of the two amounts. You also have a negative level that
      cannot be healed and that does not convert to real level loss in your
      current crystalline form. You have all the abilities you had in your
      original form, including the ability to manifest powers, so long as your
      storage crystal form has the physical ability to perform those actions.
      For example, you could not manifest Karak's bite of the wolf because your
      new form does not have a mouth. Nor could you wield a weapon, as your
      storage crystal does not have the arms to wield one.

      </p>

      <p>You have thirty days to grow an organic body, after which time your
      sentience fades and your soul passes on if it hasn't entered a new body.

      </p>

      <p>To grow a body, you (in the storage crystal) must spend ten days in
      uninterrupted solitude. The body's constituent parts are pulled as
      ectoplasm from the Astral Plane, then slowly molded and transformed into a
      living, breathing body that is an exact duplicate of your body at the time
      you manifested astral seed (the crystal itself breaks down and becomes a
      part of the new organic body). When the tenth day ends, you completely and
      totally inhabit the new body. You possess all the abilities you possessed
      when astral seed was manifested, but you have none of your equipment. You
      still suffer a negative level that does not fade unless removed by means
      such as restoration.

      </p>

      <p>If the body is struck for any amount of damage during the ten-day
      period when it is growing, it is destroyed and your soul passes on.

      </p>

      <p>Conceivably, you could manifest true mind switch to utilize a temporary
      body, but only an evil creature would smash his own temporarily empty
      storage crystal to permanently usurp a subject's organic body (unless the
      subject is itself irredeemably evil).
