      <p>You create an immobile sheet of energy of your active energy type
      (cold, electricity, fire, or sonic) formed out of unstable ectoplasm. One
      side of the wall, selected by you, sends forth waves of energy, dealing
      2d6 points of damage to creatures and objects within 10 feet and 1d6
      points of damage to those beyond 10 feet but within 20 feet. In addition,
      anyone passing though the energy wall takes 2d6 points of damage +1 point
      per manifester level (maximum +20).

      </p>

      <p>If you manifest the wall so that it appears where creatures are, each
      creature takes damage as if passing through the wall.

      </p>

      <p>If you manifest this power in the form of a ring of energy, you choose
      whether the waves of energy radiate inward or outward from the ring.

      </p><ul><li><em>Cold:</em> A sheet of this energy type deals +1 point of
      damage per die. The saving throw to reduce damage from a cold wall is a
      Fortitude save instead of a Reflex save.</li></ul>

      <ul><li><em>Electricity:</em> Manifesting a sheet of this energy type
      provides a +2 bonus to the save DC and a +2 bonus on manifester level
      checks for the purpose of overcoming power resistance.</li></ul>

      <ul><li><em>Fire:</em> A sheet of this energy type deals +1 point of
      damage per die.</li></ul>

      <ul><li><em>Sonic:</em> A sheet of this energy type deals –1 point of
      damage per die and ignores an object's hardness.</li></ul>

      <p>This power's subtype is the same as the type of energy you manifest.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> A kineticist does not need to select an
      energy type for this power when he gains psionic focus. He may choose the
      type of damage at the time the power is manifested.
