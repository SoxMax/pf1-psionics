      <p>You create a volume of sound that rises, recedes, approaches, or
      remains at a fixed place. You choose what type of sound the power creates
      when manifesting it and cannot thereafter change its basic
      character.</p><p>The volume of sound created, however, depends on your
      level. You can produce as much noise as four normal humans per manifester
      level (maximum twenty humans). Thus, talking, singing, shouting, walking,
      marching, or running sounds can be created. The noise produced can be
      virtually any type of sound within the volume limit. A horde of rats
      running and squeaking is about the same volume as eight humans running and
      shouting. A roaring lion is equal to the noise from sixteen humans, while
      a roaring dire lion is equal to the noise from twenty humans.</p><p>If you
      wish to create a specific message, up to twenty-five words can be created,
      and those words repeat over and over until the duration expires or the
      power is dismissed. If you attempt to exactly duplicate the voice of a
      specific individual or an inherently terrifying sound (such as a dragon's
      roar), you must succeed on a Bluff check with a +2 circumstance bonus
      opposed by the listener's Sense Motive check to avoid arousing
      suspicion.</p><p>Create sound can be used to bring sounds into existence
      that you later manipulate by manifesting control sound.</p>
