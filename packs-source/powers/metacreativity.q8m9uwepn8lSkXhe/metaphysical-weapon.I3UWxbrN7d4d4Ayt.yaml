      <p>Metaphysical weapon gives a weapon a +1 enhancement bonus on attack
      rolls and damage rolls. (An enhancement bonus does not stack with a
      masterwork weapon's +1 bonus on attack rolls.)

      </p>

      <p>Alternatively, you can affect up to fifty arrows, bolts, or bullets.
      The projectiles must be of the same type, and they have to be together
      (such as in the same quiver). Projectiles, but not thrown weapons, lose
      their enhancement when used. (Treat shuriken as projectiles, rather than
      thrown weapons, for the purpose of this power.)

      </p>

      <p>You can't manifest this power on most natural weapons, including a
      psychic warrior's claw powers. This power does work on a weapon brought
      into being by the graft weapon power.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> If you spend 4 additional power points, this
      power's duration increases to 1 hour per level. Additionally, for every 4
      additional power points you spend augmenting this power, this power
      improves the weapon's enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls
      by 1. This bonus does not allow a weapon to bypass damage reduction aside
      from magic.
