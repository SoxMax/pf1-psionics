      <p>Metaphysical weapon gives a weapon a
      +[[1+@augments.duration+@augments.amplify]] enhancement bonus on attack
      rolls and damage rolls. (An enhancement bonus does not stack with a
      masterwork weapon's +1 bonus on attack rolls.)</p><p>Alternatively, you
      can affect up to fifty arrows, bolts, or bullets. The projectiles must be
      of the same type, and they have to be together (such as in the same
      quiver). Projectiles, but not thrown weapons, lose their enhancement when
      used. (Treat shuriken as projectiles, rather than thrown weapons, for the
      purpose of this power.)</p><p>You can't manifest this power on most
      natural weapons, including a psychic warrior's claw powers. This power
      does work on a weapon brought into being by the graft weapon
      power.</p><p><strong>Augment:</strong> If you spend 4 additional power
      points, this power's duration increases to 1 hour per level. Additionally,
      for every 4 additional power points you spend augmenting this power, this
      power improves the weapon's enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage
      rolls by 1. This bonus does not allow a weapon to bypass damage reduction
      aside from magic.</p>
