  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You coalesce semi-stable ectoplasm into one arrow, crossbow bolt, or
      sling bullet appropriate to your size, and encase it in a thin layer of
      stable ectoplasm. Ammunition created this way is considered masterwork (+1
      enhancement bonus on attack rolls, no direct bonus on damage rolls).
      Ephemeral ammunition has a delayed-delivery effect: After being fired, the
      bolt partially phases out of the material plane and onto the ethereal
      plane. This does not allow it to shoot through armor or walls (you still
      need clear line of effect to your target), but it does allow it to impact
      a target without the target noticing. A bolt that successfully hits a
      corporeal target embeds itself entirely in the target, but the effect is
      not obvious -- the bolt does no damage, and there's no entry wound. You
      may only have one active ephemeral bolt effect at any time and you must
      overcome any applicable power resistance for the delayed-delivery aspect
      of this power to function.

      </p>

      <p>At any point during the power's duration, as a swift action, you may
      order the ammunition to return to the material plane, at which point it
      delivers its full normal damage (adjusted for damage reduction if
      appropriate) +1d4 points of force damage before dissipating back to its
      constituent ectoplasmic particles. No external wounds are present from
      this damage. This power is frequently used to deliver poison as well as
      its usual effects; such additions to the ammunition take effect when
      damage is dealt.

      </p>

      <p>As a side property of the phasing effect, ephemeral bolts can be used
      to attack ethereal creatures while you stand on the material plane,
      although they are treated as invisible unless you can see them through
      other means. Used this way, the bolts lose their delayed-delivery property
      and are treated as normal (although they retain the bonus force damage),
      and any obstruction on either plane stops them.

      </p>

      <p>As a side property of the phasing effect, ephemeral bolts can be used
      to attack ethereal creatures while you are on the material plane or to
      attack material creatures while you are on the ethereal plane, although
      the bolts and ethereal creatures are treated as invisible unless one can
      see ethereal objects. Used this way, the bolts lose their delayed-delivery
      property and are treated as normal (although they retain the bonus force
      damage), and any obstruction on either plane stops them.

      </p>

      <p>If used to attack an incorporeal target (on either plane), the bolts do
      1d4 points of force damage on impact.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> You may augment this power in one or both of
      the following ways:

      </p><ol><li>For every 4 additional power points you spend, increase the
      force damage dealt by each bolt by one die (d4), and increase the
      enhancement bonus on attack rolls by 1.</li><li>If you spend 3 additional
      power points, the enhancement bonus on attack rolls applies to damage
      rolls as well.</li><li>For every 4 additional power points you spend, you
      can create an additional bolt, arrow, or sling bullet. All such ammunition
      must return to the material plane at the same time.</li></ol>
