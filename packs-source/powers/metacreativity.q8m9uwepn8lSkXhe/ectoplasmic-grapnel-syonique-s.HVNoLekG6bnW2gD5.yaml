    value: >-
      <p>A blob of malleable, adhesive ectoplasm shoots out from your
      outstretched hand, attached by an ectoplasmic cord. Upon hitting its
      target, this ectoplasmic grapnel reels in, pulling the target to you - or
      you to it.

      </p>

      <p>When manifesting this power, you must have a hand free, and must make a
      ranged touch attack against the target; a miss causes the grapnel to
      retract instantly without attaching to anything. Alternately, you may have
      it shoot out from your shield instead of a free hand; you still get your
      shield's AC bonus against the target, but lose it against anyone else for
      the duration of the power.

      </p>

      <p>If you target a creature no more than one size category larger than
      you, you may attempt a drag combat maneuver check. If successful, you move
      the creature 5 feet closer to you. For every 5 by which your attack
      exceeds your opponent's CMD, you can drag the target an additional 5 feet
      toward you. If the creature is willing, you may drag it up to 30 feet
      closer to you.

      </p>

      <p>If you target an unattended object, you may pull it up to 30 feet
      towards you; if this moves it into your square, you may grasp the item
      immediately as a free action, although you must have a free hand to do so.
      If you target an attended object, the ranged touch attack is made against
      the opponent, and you must succeed at a disarm or steal (your choice)
      combat maneuver check to wrest the item free.

      </p>

      <p>If you fail at the combat maneuver check (or if you target an immovable
      object such as a creature more than one size category larger than you, an
      object bolted to the floor, or a building wall, floor, or ceiling), you
      are instead moved up to 30 feet towards the target. This movement provokes
      attacks of opportunity. Alternately, you may choose to relinquish your
      grip on the ectoplasmic cord, knocking you prone and ending the power
      immediately rather than moving you towards the target. If you end your
      movement at a climbable location (such as a wall or ledge), you must
      attempt a Climb check (at normal DC) to grab hold (or pull yourself over
      the edge, in the case of a ledge); failure means you begin falling, and
      must make a second Climb check with +20 DC to catch yourself.

      </p>

      <p>If you spend a full-round action bracing yourself before manifesting
      this power, you get a +2 bonus on the above combat maneuver checks. Each
      adjacent ally that spends an Aid Another action to grab hold of you also
      adds a +2 bonus to your combat maneuver check, but also suffers the
      consequence of being dragged or knocked prone with you should the check
      fail. If the power duration should be extended beyond instantaneous (see
      augment below), each ally holding onto you must spend an Aid Another
      action each turn to maintain their hold. If you end your movement at a
      climbable location, each ally may make a Climb check to grab the wall, or
      may instead continue holding onto you; your own Climb check is penalized
      as normal if their combined weight drops your encumbrance into a category
      with a worse armor check penalty.

      </p>

      <p>If you manifest this power while engaged in a grapple that you are in
      control of, you immediately make a grapple combat maneuver check; failure
      means you are no longer grappling the creature, while success means you
      gain a +2 bonus to your drag combat maneuver check for each creature
      (besides yourself) participating in the grapple. If the drag combat
      maneuver check fails, you and everyone in the grapple are dragged (or
      knocked prone) accordingly.

      </p>

      <p>If you manifest this power while engaged in a grapple that you are not
      in control of, you immediately make a grapple combat maneuver check;
      success means you have broken free of the grapple, while failure means you
      are still grappling (but gain a +2 bonus to your drag combat maneuver
      check for each creature (besides yourself) participating in the grapple).
      If the drag combat maneuver check fails, you and everyone in the grapple
      are dragged (or knocked prone) accordingly, unless the creature grappling
      you is too large for you to drag (in which case the cord snaps and the
      power fails). The grappling creature may voluntarily release you from the
      grapple to avoid being dragged or knocked prone, but must do so before the
      combat maneuver check is rolled.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> You can augment this power in one or more of
      the following ways:

      </p><ol><li>If you spend 2 additional power points, the duration increases
      to 1 round/level if the ranged touch attack hits. The cord does not
      automatically retract; you may choose to retract or extend the cord up to
      30 feet (to the limit of the power's range) as a standard action, and must
      succeed at a combat maneuver check each time you attempt to drag an
      unwilling creature in this manner. Other creatures may climb or manipulate
      the cord as they would a rope, but it is as strong as a chain. An
      unwilling creature attached to the grapnel must cut (5 hp, hardness 10, AC
      10) or burst (Str DC 26) the cord to move away from you, unless he
      succeeds at a drag combat maneuver check to pull you behind him. If the
      cord is cut or burst, or if you let go of the cord (a free action), the
      power ends immediately.</li><li>If you spend 2 additional power points,
      the range of the power increases to Medium (100 ft. + 10
      ft./level).</li><li>If you spend 4 additional power points, the cord
      retracts the full length instantly. A successful combat maneuver check, by
      any margin, pulls the target adjacent to you, while a failed combat
      maneuver check pulls you adjacent to the target (unless you relinquish the
      cord and go prone instead).</li><li>For every 4 additional power points
      you spend, this power can drag creatures an additional size category
      larger than you, and the cord's hardness increases by 2, hit points
      increases by 10, and break DC increases by 2.</li><li>If you spend 4
      additional power points, you can manifest this power as a move action. In
      addition, for every 2 additional power points you spend to achieve any of
      these effects, you also gain a +1 bonus on any combat maneuver checks or
      Climb checks you make for this power.</li></ol>
