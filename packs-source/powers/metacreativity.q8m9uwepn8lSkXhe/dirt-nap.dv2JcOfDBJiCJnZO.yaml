      <p>With a wrenching moan, an extradimensional space opens at your feet,
      resembling a freshly excavated grave. This grave generally appears as a
      5-ft. by 10-ft. rectangle but its interior is always adequate for those
      who inhabit it. Creatures in the extradimensional space are hidden, beyond
      the reach of powers (including clairsentience powers), unless those powers
      work across planes. The space holds as many as eight creatures (of any
      size).

      </p>

      <p>The interface between this extradimensional space and the material
      plane is semi-solid and can support covering materials such as spread
      straw or a sleeping bag. The interface can support up to 20 pounds of
      material. Such items can be placed from within the space by reaching up
      then gently retracting your hands, leaving the items above what you now
      see as your ceiling.

      </p>

      <p>Powers cannot be manifested across the extradimensional interface, nor
      can area effects cross it. Those in the extradimensional space can see out
      of it as usual but those outside see only an empty grave plot. Anything
      inside the extradimensional space is ejected when the power ends. Only one
      creature at a time can cross through the interface.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment: </strong>For every two additional power points you
      spend, this power can shelter an additional creature.
