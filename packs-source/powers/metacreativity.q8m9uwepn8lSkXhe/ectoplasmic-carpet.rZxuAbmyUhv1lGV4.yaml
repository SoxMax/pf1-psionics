      <p>A glossy sheet of soft ectoplasm coheres in space to do your bidding.
      When you manifest this power, you must choose one of the several modes in
      which it can operate. Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed for
      this manifestation.

      </p>

      <p><em>Flying</em>: In this mode, an <em>ectoplasmic carpet </em>acts as a
      <em>flying carpet </em>of the same size. Unaugmented, it can carry up to
      200 lbs. and has a fly speed of 40 ft. plus the usual <em>overland flight
      </em>capability.

      </p>

      <p><em>Restraint: </em>In this mode, an <em>ectoplasmic carpet </em>can
      wrap itself around a creature’s arms, preventing them from being used to
      wield weapons or perform fine activities using hands. The carpet is
      treated as a set of masterwork manacles (Escape Artist DC 35 or Strength
      check DC 28 to escape or break) but also constrains the target’s fingers.
      This imposes an Arcane Spell Failure chance of 20% upon those to whom it
      may apply. A creature can make a Reflex save to avoid being ensnared by a
      carpet in this mode. As a move action, you can direct the carpet to a
      target within range, and as a standard action you can attempt to ensnare a
      creature. Only one creature can be held at a time and releasing a creature
      is a free action.

      </p>

      <p><em>Shield: </em>In this mode, an ectoplasmic carpet acts as a sheet of
      protective material that you can move around within your space as a free
      action. This functions as a heavy shield (+2 shield bonus to AC) but only
      against ranged attacks as it is too insubstantial to interfere with melee
      attacks. This shield has no armor check penalty or Arcane Spell Failure
      chance since it is weightless and encumbrance-free.

      </p>

      <p><em>Tripping: </em>In this mode, an <em>ectoplasmic carpet </em>can be
      slipped beneath the feet of an opponent then telekinetically pulled out
      from beneath them. This requires a move action to mentally direct the
      carpet to slide underneath a target within range, and a standard action to
      perform a trip attempt. You use your manifester level in place of your
      base attack bonus and your primary manifesting ability modifier in place
      of Strength for calculating your CMB for this trip attempt. You cannot
      trip a creature larger than this carpet.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment: </strong>This power may be augmented in one or more of
      the following ways:

      </p><ul><li>For every additional two power points you spend, the basic
      flying mode carpet expands one size as per <em>flying carpet</em>. The
      first augmentation increases the carpet to 5-ft. by 10-ft. and carrying
      capacity to 400 lbs. The second augmentation increases the carpet to
      10-ft. by 10-ft. and carrying capacity to 800 lbs. Each subsequent
      augmentation increases size by two 5-ft. squares and carrying capacity by
      400 lbs. Any carpet augmented to 10-ft. by 10-ft. or larger changes its
      duration to 1 hour/ level.</li><li>For every additional power point you
      spend, the DCs for escaping or breaking a restraint carpet increase by
      1.</li><li>For every additional three power points you spend, the shield
      bonus granted by a basic shield carpet increases by 1.</li><li>For every
      additional four power points you spend, the basic tripping mode carpet
      becomes one size larger (from a 5-ft. square appropriate to a Medium
      creature to a 10-ft. square appropriate to a Large creature, then to a
      15-ft. square appropriate to a Huge creature and so on). A tripping carpet
      that is large enough may be used to trip multiple creatures at once if
      they all fit within its area.</li></ul>
