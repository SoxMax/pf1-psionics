      <p>You create a cloud of whirling, razor-sharp crystals around yourself.
      When you manifest this power, choose defensive or offensive (you may alter
      this choice as a swift action). While this power is in defensive mode, the
      shards lock together to protect you from attacks; you gain a +3 shield
      bonus to AC, as well as a +3 competence bonus to Reflex saves. While this
      power is in offensive mode, creatures within a 10 ft. radius of you suffer
      5d6 slashing damage at the beginning of each round (and whenever they
      voluntarily enter a space within 10 ft. of you) and must succeed at a
      Reflex save or suffer 2d6 bleed damage.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> You may augment this power in one or both of
      the following ways:

      </p><ol><li>For every 2 additional power points you spend, the bonuses
      granted by the defensive mode increase by 1, and the damage of the
      offensive mode increases by 1 #ie (d6; this includes the bleed
      damage).</li></ol>

      <p>• For every 2 additional power points you spend, the area of the
      offensive mode increases by 5 ft.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Surge Augmentation:</strong> If you invoke your wild surge
      while manifesting this power, you may choose to manifest it in both
      defensive and offensive mode at the same time. If you do so, you may not
      switch its mode for this manifestation, and its duration is cut in half
      (rounded down).
