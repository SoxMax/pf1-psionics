      <p>You draw writhing strands of ectoplasm from the Astral Plane that wrap
      up the subject like a mummy. The subject can still breathe but is
      otherwise helpless, unable to see outside the cocoon, speak, or take any
      physical actions. The subject's nostrils are clear (air passes through the
      cocoon normally). The subject can execute purely mental actions (such as
      manifesting powers or casting spells with no verbal, somatic, or material
      components).

      </p>

      <p>Cutting or damaging the cocoon can free a victim. The cocoon has
      hardness 8 and 20 hit points. Teleportation and other forms of travel
      provide a means of escape, but the cocoon extends into the Ethereal Plane,
      blocking ethereal travel. An ectoplasmic cocoon can't be affected by
      dispel psionics, but it can be dismissed with dismiss ectoplasm, or
      otherwise destroyed by extreme measures or items.

      </p>

      <p>The creature within the cocoon is visible only as a vague shape
      (substantial enough to interrupt line of sight) and cannot be directly
      harmed or interacted with unless the cocoon is destroyed. The cocooned
      creature can be moved normally (the weight of the cocoon is negligible).

      </p>

      <p>A creature that is cocooned while aloft begins to fall immediately, and
      a creature that is cocooned while swimming or underwater may drown.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> You can augment this power in one or both of
      the following ways.

      </p><ol><li>For every 2 additional power points you spend, this power's
      save DC increases by 1. # For every 2 additional power points you spend,
      this</li></ol>

      <p>power can affect a target one size category larger.
