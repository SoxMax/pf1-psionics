      <p>You cover yourself with charged ectoplasm that reacts to any physical
      attacks by transforming the kinetic energy into volatile crystal shards.
      Any creature striking you with its body, natural weapon, or a handheld
      weapon takes 2d6 points of piercing damage. Each time the power
      discharges, the number of dice is halved, down to a minimum of 1d6.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> This power can be augmented in one or more of
      the following ways.

      </p><ol><li>For every 2 additional power points you spend, increase the
      base damage by +2d6.</li><li>If you spend 2 additional power points, each
      discharge only removes 1d6 from the next damage, instead of halving
      it.</li><li>If you spend 2 additional power points, you also gain 3
      temporary hit points per die of base damage.</li></ol>
