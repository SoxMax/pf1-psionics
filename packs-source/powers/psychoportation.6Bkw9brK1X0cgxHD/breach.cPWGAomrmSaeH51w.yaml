      <p>You psionically open stuck, barred, or locked doors, as well as those
      subject to hold portal or arcane lock. When you complete the manifestation
      of this power, make a manifester level check against the DC of the lock
      with a +10 bonus. If successful, you open up to two means of closure. This
      power opens secret doors, as well as locked or trickopening boxes or
      chests. This also loosens welds, shackles, or chains (provided they serve
      to hold something shut). If used to open an arcane locked door, the power
      does not remove the arcane lock but simply suspends its functioning for 10
      minutes. In all other cases, the door does not relock itself or become
      stuck again on its own. This does not raise barred gates or similar
      impediments (such as a portcullis), nor does it affect ropes, vines, and
      the like. The effect is limited by the area. Each manifestation can undo
      as many as two means of preventing access.
