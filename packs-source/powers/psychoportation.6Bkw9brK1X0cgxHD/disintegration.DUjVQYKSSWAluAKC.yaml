  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A thin, green ray springs from your pointing finger. You must make a
      successful ranged touch attack to hit. Any creature struck by the ray
      takes 22d6 points of damage. Any creature reduced to 0 or fewer hit points
      by this power is entirely disintegrated, leaving behind only a trace of
      fine dust. A disintegrated creature's equipment is unaffected.

      </p>

      <p>When used against an object, the ray simply disintegrates as much as
      one 10-foot cube of nonliving matter. Thus, the power disintegrates only
      part of any very large object or structure targeted. The ray affects even
      objects constructed entirely of force, but not psionic effects such as a
      null psionics field.

      </p>

      <p>A creature or object that makes a successful Fortitude save is
      partially affected, taking only 5d6 points of damage. If this damage
      reduces the creature or object to 0 or fewer hit points, it is entirely
      disintegrated. Only the first creature or object struck can be affected;

      that is, the ray affects only one target per manifestation.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every additional power point you spend,
      the damage this power deals to a subject that fails its saving throw
      increases by 2d6 points. Augmenting this power does not change the amount
      of damage the target takes if it succeeds on its saving throw. For every
      4d6 additional damage, the power's save DC increases by 1.
