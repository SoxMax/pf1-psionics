      <p>You must be a <a href="/wiki/Highlord" title="Highlord">Highlord</a>
      following the <a href="/wiki/Sovereign_(Tenets_of_Dominance)"
      title="Sovereign (Tenets of Dominance)">Sovereign (Tenets of
      Dominance)</a> to manifest this power. You cannot learn this power with
      the <a href="/wiki/Expanded_Knowledge" title="Expanded Knowledge">Expanded
      Knowledge</a> feat or similar abilities.

      </p>

      <p>You expand your presence, using the minds of your collective as
      psychoportive beacons. Even if you’re standing in plain view, you seem to
      be everywhere and nowhere, appearing in the corner of a creature’s vision,
      laying a reassuring hand on an ally’s shoulder, pushing a blade through a
      foe’s chest, or even all of these at once.

      </p>

      <p>While under the effect of this power, you threaten all spaces within 5
      feet of you, and can make attacks of opportunity against targets within
      this area with any weapon you are wielding, even if it isn’t a melee
      weapon or can’t reach that space. In addition, you can treat yourself as
      being within any of those spaces for the purposes of your vision, and for
      determining line of effect to targets of your psionic powers and highlord
      class features. During your turn, you can also treat yourself as within
      each of those spaces for the purposes of making attacks (including drawing
      line of sight and effect, and determining threatened area).

      </p>

      <p>If a creature within your collective occupies a space in this power’s
      area, this power’s area expands to all spaces adjacent to that creature.
      This effect can chain through multiple collective members, allowing the
      power’s area it continue to change as your collective repositions.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment: </strong>This power can be augmented in one or more of
      the following ways.

      </p><ol><li>For every additional power point you spend, attacks against
      you suffer a 5% miss chance. This effect is cumulative with multiple power
      points spent, up to a maximum miss chance of 50%.</li><li>For every
      additional power point you spend, you can make 1 additional attack of
      opportunity in each round during the duration of this power.</li><li>For
      every 4 additional power points you spend, the distance this power reaches
      from you (and any collective members in the area) increases by 5
      feet.</li><li>If you spend 6 additional power points, you gain the ability
      to switch positions with members of your collective within the power’s
      area; doing so is a move action that does not provoke attacks of
      opportunity.</li><li>If you spend 8 additional power points, you can
      choose a single collective member to center this power’s effect on,
      instead of yourself. You do not create the power’s effect around yourself
      if you do so, but you can still act through the area of the power as
      normal. If you manifest the power in this way, you take half the damage
      the chosen collective member does. This damage cannot be reduced or
      nullified in any way.</li></ol>
