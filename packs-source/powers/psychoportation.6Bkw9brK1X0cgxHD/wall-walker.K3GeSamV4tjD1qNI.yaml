      <p>You can walk on vertical surfaces or even traverse ceilings (you need
      not make Climb checks to traverse these surfaces). Because of the need to
      keep at least one foot in contact with the wall or ceiling at all times,
      you cannot jump or use the run action, and you can move at only half
      speed.

      </p>

      <p>You retain your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class, if any, and opponents
      gain no special bonuses against you.
