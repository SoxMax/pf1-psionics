  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You create a circle on the floor or other horizontal surface that
      teleports, as greater psychoport, any creature who stands on it to a
      designated spot. Once you designate the destination for the circle, you
      can't change it. The power fails if you attempt to set the circle to
      teleport creatures into a solid object, to a place with which you are not
      familiar and have no clear description, or to another plane.

      </p>

      <p>The circle itself is subtle and nearly impossible to notice. If you
      intend to keep creatures from activating it accidentally, you need to mark
      the circle in some way.

      </p>

      <p>Magic traps such as psychoportation circle are hard to detect and
      disable. A character with the trapfinding class feature can use the
      Disable Device to disarm magic traps. The DC in each case is 25 + spell
      level, or 34 in the case of psychoportation circle.
