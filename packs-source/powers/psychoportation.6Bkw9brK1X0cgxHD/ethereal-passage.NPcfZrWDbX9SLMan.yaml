      <p>You create an ethereal passage through wooden, plaster, or stone walls,
      but not other materials. The ethereal passage is invisible and
      inaccessible to all creatures except you, and only you can use the
      passage. You disappear when you enter the ethereal passage and appear when
      you exit. If you desire, you can take one other creature (Medium or
      smaller) through the passage. This counts as two uses of the passage. The
      passage does not allow light, sound, or power effects through it, nor can
      you see through it without using it. Thus, the power can provide an escape
      route, though certain creatures, such as phase spiders, can follow with
      ease. A gem of true seeing or similar ability reveals the presence of an
      ethereal passage but does not allow its use.

      </p>

      <p>An ethereal passage is subject to dispel psionics. If anyone is within
      the passage when it is dispelled, he is harmlessly ejected just as if he
      were inside a passwall effect.

      </p>

      <p>You can allow other creatures to use the ethereal passage by setting
      some triggering condition for the door. Such conditions can be as simple
      or elaborate as you desire. They can be based on a creature's name,
      identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions
      or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, HD, and hit points don't
      qualify.
