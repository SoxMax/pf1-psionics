      <p>You move yourself or some other creature to another plane of existence
      or alternate dimension. If several willing persons link hands in a circle,
      as many as eight can be affected by the power at the same time. Precise
      accuracy as to a particular arrival location on the intended plane is nigh
      impossible. From the Material Plane, you can reach any other plane, though
      you appear 5 to 500 miles (5d%) from your intended destination. Planar
      travel transports creatures instantaneously and then ends. The creatures
      need to find other means if they are to travel back (including manifesting
      planar travel again).

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every two additional power points spent,
      the number of d% rolled is reduced by 1, to a maximum of -5, when the
      power places you at your intended destination.
