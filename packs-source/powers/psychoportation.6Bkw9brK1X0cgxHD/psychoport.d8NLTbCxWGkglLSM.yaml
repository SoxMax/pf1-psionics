      <p>This power instantly transports you to a designated destination, which
      may be as distant as 100 miles per manifester level. Interplanar travel is
      not possible. You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn't
      exceed your maximum load. You may also bring one additional willing Medium
      or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or
      its equivalent per three manifester levels. A Large creature counts as two
      Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as four Medium creatures, and so
      forth. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one
      another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you.
      As with all powers where the range is personal and the target is you, you
      need not make a saving throw, nor is power resistance applicable to you.
      Only objects held or in use (attended) by another person receive saving
      throws and power resistance.

      </p>

      <p>You must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the
      destination. The clearer your mental image, the more likely the
      teleportation works. Areas of strong physical or psionic energy may make
      teleportation more hazardous or even impossible.

      </p>

      <p>To see how well the teleportation works, roll d% and consult the table
      at the end of this power. Refer to the following information for
      definitions of the terms on the table.

      </p><ul><li><em>Familiarity:</em> "Very familiar" is a place where you
      have been very often and where you feel at home. "Studied carefully" is a
      place you know well, either because you can currently physically see it or
      you've been there often. "Seen casually" is a place that you have seen
      more than once but with which you are not very familiar. "Viewed once" is
      a place that you have seen once, possibly using powers such as remote
      viewing.</li></ul>

      <ul><li>"False destination" is a place that does not truly exist or if you
      are teleporting to an otherwise familiar location that no longer exists as
      such or has been so completely altered as to no longer be familiar to you.
      When traveling to a false destination, roll 1d20+80 to obtain results on
      the table, rather than rolling d%, since there is no real destination for
      you to hope to arrive at or even be off target from.</li></ul>

      <ul><li><em>On Target:</em> You appear where you want to be.</li></ul>

      <ul><li><em>Off Target:</em> You appear safely a random distance away from
      the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is d% of the
      distance that was to be traveled. The direction off target is determined
      randomly.</li></ul>

      <ul><li><em>Similar Area:</em> You wind up in an area that's visually or
      thematically similar to the target area. Generally, you appear in the
      closest similar place within range. If no such area exists within the
      power's range, the power simply fails instead.</li></ul>

      <ul><li><em>Mishap:</em> You and anyone else teleporting with you have
      gotten "scrambled." You each take 1d10 points of damage, and you reroll on
      the chart to see where you wind up. For these rerolls, roll 1d20+80. Each
      time "Mishap" comes up, the characters take more damage and must
      reroll.</li></ul>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every 2 additional power points you
      spend, consider the familiarity of a location 1 step better, with the
      exception of a false destination, which is always considered a false
      destination.
