      <p>You instantly transfer yourself from your current location to any other
      spot within range to which you have line of sight. You can bring along
      possessions that amount to as much as a medium load, including living
      creatures that weigh as much as 20 pounds. Movement caused by the use of
      dimension slide does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

      </p>

      <p>If you somehow attempt to transfer yourself to a location occupied by a
      solid body or a location you can't see the power simply fails to function.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> If you spend 4 additional power points, you
      can manifest this power as a move action.
