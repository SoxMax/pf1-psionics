      <p>Until the end of your turn, the next successful melee attack you make,
      you and the creature struck swap positions.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Trigger:</strong> If your attack was successful and an ally
      attacks the target before the end of your next turn, you can expend your
      psionic focus to allow both you and the attacking ally to treat the target
      as if it was being flanked until the end of your next turn.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> If you spend 6 additional power points, you
      can instead manifest this power upon making a successful melee attack and
      have the effects of this power instead apply to that attack. Doing so
      still uses your swift action for the round.
