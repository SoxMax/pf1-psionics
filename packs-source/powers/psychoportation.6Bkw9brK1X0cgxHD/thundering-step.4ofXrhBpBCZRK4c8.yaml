      <p>Manifesting this power does not provoke attacks of opportunity. As part
      of manifesting this power, make a single melee attack. If your attack is
      successful, you deal an additional +3d6 points of sonic damage and the
      target is dazed until the end of its next turn. Power resistance applies
      to the dazed effect, but does not apply to the additional damage to your
      attack.

      </p>

      <p>After the attack, regardless of if it is successful, you can teleport
      up to 30 feet from your current location. Each enemy you end up adjacent
      to must make a Fortitude save or become dazed until the end of your next
      turn. Your initial target is immune to this effect if you teleport
      adjacent to it. Power resistance applies to this effect.

      </p>
