      <p>Over the manifestation of this power, you siphon off tiny slices of
      yourself from the current timestream, cementing your physical form where
      it is when you manifest this power. Note your current hit point total,
      physical ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution), and any
      conditional modifiers or conditions such as ability damage to physical
      ability scores, disease, negative levels, and poison. If at any point
      within the duration of the power you are reduced to fewer than 0 hit
      points or are slain by a death effect that is not mind-affecting, you can
      immediately let your current physical body die and assume the timestepped
      form of your physical body on your next turn.

      </p>

      <p>When this happens, your corpse disappears, and you can either resume
      the place of your dead body (already wearing any clothing still attached
      to the corpse) or appear in any place you’ve been within 500 feet of where
      your corpse lies (but without any of your gear).

      </p>

      <p>You still retain your original mind, and therefore don’t regain any
      power points or expended abilities. You are still under any mental
      influences and energy drain effects you were under when you recalled the
      form of your physical body, but don’t retain any physical effects such as
      bleed damage or poison (unless you suffered from these conditions at the
      time the power was manifest). Spells and powers affecting you when you
      time-stepped your body abide by their normal durations. Manifesting this
      power again replaces any previous version of yourself that you
      time-stepped.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment: </strong>If you spend 2 additional power points, no
      time has passed for your time-stepped body when you recall it, so all
      powers and effects that were active when you time-stepped are once again
      active when you recall it.
