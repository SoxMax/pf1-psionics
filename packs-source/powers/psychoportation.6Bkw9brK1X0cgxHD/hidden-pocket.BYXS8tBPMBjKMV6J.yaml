      <p>You transfer one touched object to an extradimensional pocket of space
      in the palm of your hand. This extradimensional space is invisible and
      weightless, regardless of the weight of the item inside it. When the power
      ends, the object returns to your hand, although if your hand is not free,
      the object instead falls to the ground at your feet. You may only have one
      such extradimensional pocket active at any given time.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> You can augment this power in one or both of
      the following ways.

      </p><ol><li>For every 2 additional power points you spend, the object
      being stored can weigh an additional pound per level.</li><li>For every 2
      additional power points you spend, you can have one additional item in
      your extradimensional pocket, although you are still restricted to the
      weight limit for all of the items combined.</li><li>If you spend 4
      additional power points, the duration increases to one day.</li></ol>
