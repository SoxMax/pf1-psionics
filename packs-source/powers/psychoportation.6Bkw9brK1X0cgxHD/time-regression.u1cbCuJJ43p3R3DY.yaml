      <p>You can regress apparent time 1 round into the past. In effect, you
      "replay" the previous round of activity. The power regresses time to the
      point along the time stream just prior to your previous turn, undoing the
      effects of everyone else's actions in the meantime. Once you have used
      time regression, only you retain knowledge of what happened during the
      round that is being replayed; however, you can communicate that knowledge
      verbally to your companions, if desired. During the round that you live
      through a second time, you can act on knowledge you previously gained by
      already living through the immediate future. In all likelihood, you'll
      probably not choose to manifest time regression during your second pass
      through the time stream, instead taking completely new actions.

      </p>

      <p>Altering the time stream in such a fashion is mentally taxing and you
      suffer 2 points of ability damage to Charisma, Intelligence, and Wisdom.
      This damage cannot be ignored through any special effects or abilities,
      but can be healed as any other ability damage.
