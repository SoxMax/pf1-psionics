      <p>You can move and attack normally for the duration of the power, even
      under the influence of effects that usually impedes movement, such as
      paralysis, solid fog, slow, and web. All combat maneuver checks made to
      grapple you automatically fail. You automatically succeed on any combat
      maneuver checks and Escape Artist checks made to escape a grapple or a
      pin.

      </p>

      <p>You can also move and attack normally while underwater, even with
      slashing weapons such as axes and swords or with bludgeoning weapons such
      as flails, hammers, and maces, provided that the weapon is wielded in the
      hand rather than hurled. This does not, however, grant water breathing.
