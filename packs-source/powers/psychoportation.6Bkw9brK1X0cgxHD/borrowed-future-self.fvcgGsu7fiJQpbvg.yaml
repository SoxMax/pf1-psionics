    value: >-
      <p>You reach out into all your possible futures and for a short while, you
      draw a fragment of your future self into this time. Your duplicate has no
      actual substance, it only looks like you, and you cannot use it to alter
      its surroundings or to attack or otherwise harm creatures it encounters.
      You can use the duplicate to speak, and interact verbally with creatures
      using the Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate skills.

      </p>

      <p>You can see, hear, taste, and smell your duplicate's surroundings as if
      you are actually present in its location using your Perception or Sense
      Motive skills. While you also remain aware of your own immediate
      surroundings when controlling your duplicate, controlling it does take a
      toll on your senses. You take a –4 penalty on Perception checks while you
      control your duplicate.

      </p>

      <p>The duplicate moves under your mental command, and while you need not
      act out its movements, you must take a standard action to control your
      duplicate for 1 round (concentrating on the power) or it winks out of
      existence. You can maintain control of your duplicate even if you have no
      line of sight or line of effect to it.

      </p>

      <p>The duplicate immediately winks out of existence if it is hit by an
      attack or in the area of a damaging effect, or if it moves beyond the
      maximum range of the power.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> This power can be augmented in one or more of
      the following ways.

      </p><ol><li>If you spend 2 additional power points, you can define what
      your duplicate should do and general orders and it will do this by it's
      own volition, as if you were the duplicate. You can still use your senses
      through the duplicate if you manifest it like this, but cannot influence
      its actions once triggered.</li><li>If you spend 2 additional power
      points, the duration increases to 10 minutes/level.</li></ol>
