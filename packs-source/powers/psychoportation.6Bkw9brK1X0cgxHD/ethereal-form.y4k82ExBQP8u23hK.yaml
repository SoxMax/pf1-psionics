    value: >-
      <p>You become ethereal, along with your equipment. For the duration of the
      power, you are in the Ethereal Plane, which overlaps the Material Plane.
      When the power expires, you return to material existence.

      </p>

      <p>An ethereal creature is invisible, insubstantial, and capable of moving
      in any direction, even up or down, albeit at half normal speed. As an
      insubstantial creature, you can move through solid objects, including
      living creatures. An ethereal creature can see and hear on the Material
      Plane, but everything looks gray and ephemeral. Sight and hearing onto the
      Material Plane are limited to 60 feet.

      </p>

      <p>Force effects and abjurations affect an ethereal creature normally.
      Their effects extend onto the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, but
      not vice versa. An ethereal creature can't attack material creatures, and
      powers you manifest while ethereal affect only other ethereal things.
      Certain material creatures or objects have attacks or effects that work on
      the Ethereal Plane.

      </p>

      <p>Treat other ethereal creatures and ethereal objects as if they were
      material.

      </p>

      <p>If you end the power and become material while inside a material object
      (such as a solid wall), you are shunted off to the nearest open space and
      take 1d6 points of damage per 5 feet that you so travel.
