  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You and any creature you touch are drawn along a crystal arc of reverie
      to the edge of conscious thought and into the region of dreams. You can
      take more than one creature along with you (subject to your level limit),
      but each one must be touching another one. You physically enter the land
      of dreams, leaving nothing behind.

      </p>

      <p>In the region of dreams, you move through a menagerie of thoughts,
      desires, and phantoms created by the minds of dreamers everywhere. For
      every minute you move through dream, you can "wake" to find yourself five
      miles displaced in the waking world. Thus, a character can use this power
      to travel rapidly by physically entering where only dreams normally prowl,
      moving the desired distance, and then stepping back into the waking world.
      You know where you will come out in the waking world.

      </p>

      <p>Dream travel can also be used to travel to the Dreamscape and other
      planes that contain creatures that dream, but doing this requires crossing
      into the dreams of outsiders, where you are subject to the vagaries of
      many dream realities—a potentially perilous proposition. Transferring to
      another plane of existence in this fashion requires 1d4 hours of
      uninterrupted travel.

      </p>

      <p>Any creatures that come along when dream travel is manifested also make
      the transition to the borders of unconscious thought. A creature separated
      from you wanders off into the dreamscape. When the duration ends, all
      affected creatures return to the waking world as much as 1,000 miles
      (d%x10) from their starting point. If a creature remains in the
      dreamscape, it is powerless to leave unless it can manifest the dream
      travel power itself or someone who manifests the power seeks out the lost
      creature.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every 2 additional power points you
      spend, this power's save DC increases by 1.
