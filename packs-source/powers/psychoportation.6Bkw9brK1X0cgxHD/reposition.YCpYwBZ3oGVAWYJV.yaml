      <table><caption>Reposition and Network

      </caption><tr><td>Because reposition carries the Network descriptor,
      willing targets within the manifester’s collective, but outside of the
      range of the power may be repositioned, but their final destination must
      be within the power’s stated range (100 ft. + 10 ft./level.) from the
      manifester’s initial location.

      <p>Additionally, the manifester himself can be affected by reposition if
      he has the collective class feature, but all range measurements are made
      from the manifester’s starting location, not his final location

      </p></td></tr></table>

      <p>You instantly reposition each willing target anywhere within Medium
      range (100 ft. + 10 ft./level) from your location to which you have line
      of effect. This does not provoke attacks of opportunity for the creatures
      moved. The destination must be a valid space; this power cannot reposition
      creatures inside of another creature, a boulder, or some other solid
      structure, etc., although it could reposition a creature through a wall,
      as long as the manifester has line of effect to the destination, or
      reposition a creature underwater, midair, or over a bonfire. Attempts to
      reposition a creature into a harmful situation allow the creature a save.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> This power may be augmented in the following
      ways.

      </p><ol><li>If you spend 6 additional power points, you may target
      unwilling creatures.</li><li>If you spend 8 additional power points, you
      may manifest this power as an immediate action.</li></ol>
