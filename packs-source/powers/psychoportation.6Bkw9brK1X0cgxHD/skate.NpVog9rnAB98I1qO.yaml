    value: >-
      <p>You, another willing creature, or an unattended object can slide along
      solid ground as if on smooth ice. If you manifest skate on yourself or
      another creature, the subject of the power retains equilibrium by mental
      desire alone, allowing her to gracefully skate along the ground, turn, or
      stop suddenly as desired. The skater's land speed increases by 15 feet.
      (This adjustment is treated as an enhancement bonus.) As with any effect
      that increases speed, this power affects the subject's maximum jumping
      distance.

      </p>

      <p>The subject can skate up or down any incline or decline she could
      normally walk upon without mishap, though skating up an incline reduces
      the subject's speed to normal, while skating down a decline increases her
      speed by an additional 15 feet. (This adjustment is treated as a
      circumstance bonus.)

      </p>

      <p>If you manifest skate on an object, treat the object as having only
      one-tenth of its normal weight for the purpose of dragging it along the
      ground.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every additional power point you spend,
      you can affect an additional target.
