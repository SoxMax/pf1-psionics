      <p>By altering the levels of probability surrounding a small object in
      motion, you can 'trick' it into performing seemingly impossible maneuvers.
      While this ability has no direct influence on an attack roll, it can
      nevertheless make a certain outcome possible in the first place.

      </p>

      <p>Until the beginning of your next turn, you may make one Tiny or smaller
      moving object perform a 'trick shot' -- a stunt that you describe -- so
      long as it is not moving under its own power (thrown objects or fired
      projectiles are not moving under their own power, while an insect or a
      flying psicrystal are). So long as the stunt can be succinctly described
      in ten words or less, it occurs, no matter how unlikely this is. This
      trick shot has no influence on attack or damage rolls, although the effect
      itself may allow an attack to occur.

      </p>

      <p>Example trick shots include the following (which are descriptive and of
      varying complexity; the sentences used in manifesting are shorter):

      </p><ul><li>Shooting an arrow through the sockets of twelve axe heads
      between you and your target</li><li>Bouncing a billiard ball off of nine
      different fixtures (including your friend's breastplate) before sinking in
      a pocket</li><li>Having a crossbow bolt "loop the loop" before impacting
      normally</li><li>Forcing a tossed coin to land, perfectly stable, on its
      edge</li><li>Getting a javelin to slalom around trees between you and your
      target</li><li>Directing the tiny bead of an undetonated fireball to fly a
      "figure eight" around its target's feet</li><li>Allowing a dagger, despite
      being pointy, to bounce off of the ground between a creature's legs and
      continue unhindered to its actual target behind him</li></ul>

      <p>Additional trick shots beyond this list are possible.

      </p>

      <p>From a combat perspective, the most powerful use of this power would be
      to shoot around corners, but doing so is treated as shooting blind. It is
      more frequently used, however, to show off outside of combat.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> You may augment this power in one or more of
      the following ways.

      </p><ol><li>Each additional power point spent allows you to affect one
      additional object before the power ends, although this cannot allow you to
      make more attacks in a standard attack or full attack than
      normal.</li><li>For every 2 additional power points you spend, the size of
      an object you can affect with this power increases one step.</li><li>For
      every additional power point you spend, the power's duration extends 1
      round. The number of objects you can alter this way remains unchanged, and
      the power still ends when these run out.</li></ol>

      <p>Additionally, every additional power point spent to achieve any of
      these effects allows for your trick shots to be described in sentences of
      up to one word longer.
