      <p>You force the target to delay their action until after the next
      creature in the initiative order takes their action unless the target
      makes a successful Will save. You must manifest this power before the
      results of the creature's actions are determined. This may result in the
      creature's action being invalid, such as attacking a target that has
      moved, in which case the action is wasted. If the target was manifesting a
      power or casting a spell, they do not need to make a concentration check.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every 3 additional power points you
      spend, the target's action is delayed until after an additional creature
      in the initiative order.
