      <p>Your ranged attacks may follow a path you imagine instead of the path
      that physical laws would dictate. You ignore range increment penalties,
      and bonuses to Armor Class from cover, although total cover still blocks
      the attack.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> You may augment this power in one or both of
      the following ways:

      </p><ol><li>If you spend 3 additional power points, your ranged attacks
      ignore concealment (but not total concealment). If you instead spend 6
      additional power points, your ranged attacks ignore all miss chances,
      including those from total concealment and effects such as mirror image
      (although you still must target the correct square for an invisible
      target).</li><li>For every 3 additional power points you spend, your range
      increment and corresponding maximum range with ranged attacks and your
      range for spells and powers that require a ranged touch attack increase by
      10 feet.</li></ol>
