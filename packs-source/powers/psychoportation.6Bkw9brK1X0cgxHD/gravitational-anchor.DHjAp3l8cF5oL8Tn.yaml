    value: >-
      <p>You generate an increased gravity field at a single point within range,
      pulling creatures and objects downward. The targeted point can be a
      creature or unattended object, but if so, the target is allowed a Reflex
      save to negate the effect.

      </p>

      <p>Each creature moving or attacking within the affected area must make a
      Reflex Save each round or be affected by the effects of the gravity field
      for that round. The increased gravity field inflicts a -2 penalty on all
      non-ray attack that pass through the affected area (even ranged attacks
      originated by or targeting creatures outside of the field), and all
      movement through the affected area counts as difficult terrain. Creatures
      attempting to fly or levitate in the field are forcibly dragged down 20
      ft. per round at the end of their turn. Any creature that falls more than
      10 ft. in the field that strikes the ground takes double damage from the
      fall. In addition, trip attempts gain a +2 circumstance bonus, rather than
      the -2 penalty, against affected targets within the field.

      </p>

      <p>Creatures benefiting from Stability or Personal Gravity, such as an
      elocater, gain a +4 bonus to their saving throw.
