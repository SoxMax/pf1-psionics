      <p>You gain the ability move yourself, another creature, or an object up
      and down as you wish. A creature must be willing to be affected, and an
      object must be unattended or possessed by a willing creature. You can
      mentally direct the recipient to move up or down as much as 20 feet each
      round; doing so is a move action. You cannot move the recipient
      horizontally, but the recipient could clamber along the face of a cliff,
      for example, or push against a ceiling to move laterally (generally at
      half its base land speed).

      </p>

      <p>An affected creature that attacks with a melee or ranged weapon finds
      itself increasingly unstable; the first attack has a –1 penalty on attack
      rolls, the second –2, and so on, to a maximum penalty of –5. A full round
      spent stabilizing allows the creature to begin again at –1.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> When a manifester other than a nomad
      manifests this power, the target is the manifester (not a willing creature
      or an object).
