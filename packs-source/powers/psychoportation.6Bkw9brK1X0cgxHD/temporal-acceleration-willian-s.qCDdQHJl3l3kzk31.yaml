      <p>You enter another time frame, speeding up so greatly that all other
      creatures seem frozen, though they are actually still moving at normal
      speed. You are free to act for 1 round of apparent time. You can manifest
      powers, cast spells, move, or perform other types of actions, subject to
      the restrictions outlined below.

      </p>

      <p>While your temporal acceleration is in effect, other creatures are
      invulnerable to your attacks and powers. This means you cannot target a
      creature with any attack or power. However, a power you manifest that
      affects an area and has a duration longer than the remaining duration of
      your temporal acceleration has its normal effect on  creatures in the area
      once this power ends.

      </p>

      <p>You can affect an unattended object but not an object held, carried, or
      worn by another creature. You are undetectable by any means while your
      temporal acceleration lasts.

      </p>

      <p>While under the effect of this power, you cannot enter an area
      protected by a null psionics field or by a power or spell that neutralizes
      high-level powers or spells. Normal and magical fire, cold, acid, and the
      like can still harm you.

      </p>

      <p>When your temporal acceleration expires, you resume acting during your
      current turn in the standard time frame. You are shaken for 1 round upon
      your return to the standard time frame.

      </p>

      <p>Splintered or partitioned minds within your own mind, such as might be
      in effect through the use of powers such as schism, are not temporally
      speeded up, even if your second mind manifested this power (your primary
      mind gains the benefit, while your second mind remains stuck in the
      standard time frame).

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every 4 additional power points you
      spend, this power's duration (in apparent time) increases by 1 round.
