      <p>You teleport blood and vital fluids from your target's body. The target
      suffers 1d4 points of Constitution damage (save for half). If you feed on
      blood or life force (such as if you are a vampire or a wight), you may
      teleport the removed fluids into your own body, gaining 3 temporary hit
      points per point of Constitution damage dealt by this power; these do not
      stack with other uses of this power, and last for up to 1 hour. These
      temporary hit points may be used to satisfy feeding requirements, if
      applicable.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every 4 power points you spend, the
      damage of this power increases by one die (d4) and its save DC is
      increased by 2.
