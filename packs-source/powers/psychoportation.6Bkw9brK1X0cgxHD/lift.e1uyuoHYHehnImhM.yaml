  description:
    value: >-
      <p>With a mental thrust you fling your foe upwards then suspend them
      there. When you manifest <em>lift</em>, you cause a target to float
      unnaturally five feet above the ground. This typically prevents them from
      moving though creatures which can fly are unaffected by <em>lift</em>.
      Additionally, a creature that is able to react walls, items, or creatures
      nearby may be able to push themselves horizontally. This requires
      deliberate intent, so a target creature kicking or punching an adjacent
      foe does not float away unexpectedly.

      </p>

      <p>This power is inherently stable and being suspended in midair does not
      impose any penalty on actions the target creature might undertake
      excepting movement. Each round at the end of its turn, the target creature
      makes an additional save at the original DC of this power to terminate its
      effects.
