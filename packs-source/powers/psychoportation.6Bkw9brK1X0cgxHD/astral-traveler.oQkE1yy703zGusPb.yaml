      <p>This power allows you or a creature you touch to participate in an
      astral caravan created through use of the astral caravan power. While
      participating in a journey allowed by the astral caravan power, you must
      hold the hand of both your fellow passenger ahead of you (or the caravan
      leader) and your fellow passenger behind you (unless you happen to be the
      last in the hand-linked line). If you or any one of your fellow passengers
      breaks the handto-hand link for 2 consecutive rounds, the impetus through
      the Astral Plane provided by astral caravan fails. See the <em><a
      href="/wiki/Astral_Caravan" title="Astral Caravan">astral caravan</a></em>
      power for more information.

      </p>

      <p>All those who are part of the caravan who are capable of performing
      purely mental actions, such as manifesting a power, may do so while
      maintaining hand-to-hand contact with their fellow travelers. When astral
      travelers begin their journey, each one is connected to the Material Plane
      by an insubstantial silvery cord. Very few weapons exist that can damage a
      silvery cord.

      </p>

      <p>The last creature in the line of those making up the caravan is
      sometimes referred to as the rear guard, because he or she has one hand
      free and can use it to wield a weapon without relinquishing his or her
      grip on the next traveler in line. The weightless, subjective environment
      of the Astral Plane allows the caravan to flex and bend as necessary to
      bring the rear guard's weapon to bear.
