    value: >-
      <p>Until the end of your turn, the next successful melee attack you make
      deals an additional +1d4 points of damage and temporarily attunes you to
      the creature struck. A creature with power resistance may attempt to block
      you attuning to it, but power resistance does not affect the additional
      damage to your attack.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Trigger:</strong> If the target is not adjacent to you at the
      end of its next turn, you can expend your psionic focus as a free action
      to teleport adjacent to it, as long as it is within Close range (25 ft. +
      5 ft./2 levels).

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> If you spend 6 additional power points, you
      can instead manifest this power upon making a successful melee attack and
      have the effects of this power instead apply to that attack. Doing so
      still uses your swift action for the round.
