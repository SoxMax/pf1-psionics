      <p>You send a summon out across your collective calling all of the members
      to aid you. All members of the collective that are located on the same
      plane and that are willing are then summoned to the closest available
      space to you and are given one of three options.

      </p><ul><li>+3 competence bonus on attack and damage rolls</li><li>+3
      competence bonus on saving throws and AC</li></ul>

      <p>The competence bonuses last for one round per manifester level. If this
      power is used during combat and the creatures summoned had not yet rolled
      initiative, they immediately roll initiative. If their initiative is
      higher than yours, they may immediately take this round's actions and then
      resume normal initiative order the next round. Creatures summoned
      immediately receive their bonus.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> This power may be augmented in one or more of
      the following ways.

      </p><ol><li>By spending 2 additional power points, the power can summon
      members, including the manifester, to a particular member of the
      collective instead of to the manifester.</li><li>By spending 2 additional
      power points, this power can summon members of the collective across
      planar boundaries.</li><li>By spending 4 additional power points, this
      power's manifesting time becomes an immediate action.</li></ol>
