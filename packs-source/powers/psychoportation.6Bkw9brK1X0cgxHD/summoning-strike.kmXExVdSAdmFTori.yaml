      <p>You attempt to teleport one creature within range to a space adjacent
      to you unless it makes a successful Will saving throw. On a failed save,
      the target is teleported to an open space adjacent to you and you may make
      a single melee attack against the target. If there is no space adjacent to
      you where the target can stand, or where there is not firm ground, the
      power fails.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every additional 4 power points spent,
      the maximum size of the target is increased by one step (large, huge, etc)
      and the save DC increases by 2.
