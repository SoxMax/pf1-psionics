  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A green ray springs from your hand. You must make a ranged touch attack
      to hit the target. Any creature or object struck by the ray is covered
      with a shimmering field that completely blocks extradimensional travel,
      wrenching it fully in its current planar location. Forms of movement
      barred by this include astral projection, blink, dimension door, ethereal
      form, ethereal jaunt, etherealness, gate, maze, plane shift, teleport, and
      similar abilities. The power also prevents the use of a gate or
      teleportation circle for the duration.

      </p>

      <p>Wrench does not interfere with the movement of creatures already in
      ethereal or astral form when the power is manifested, nor does it block
      extradimensional perception or attack forms. Also, wrench does not prevent
      summoned creatures from disappearing at the end of a summoning power.
