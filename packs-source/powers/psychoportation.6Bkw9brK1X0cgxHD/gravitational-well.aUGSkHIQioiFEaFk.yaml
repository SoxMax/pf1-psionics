  description:
    value: >-
      <p>An artificial well of gravity manifests on the target, pulling other
      objects in towards it. All attacks against the target gain a +2
      circumstance bonus to the attack roll as attacks are drawn toward it from
      the increased gravitational pull.

      </p>

      <p>In addition, attacks made against any other creatures within 10 ft. of
      the target suffer a -2 penalty to attack rolls, as the altered gravity
      attempts to pull the attack toward the affected creature.

      </p>

      <p>Any attempt to move closer to or around the target is unhindered, but
      any attempt to move away from the affected creature is treated as
      difficult terrain until more than 10 ft. away. A successful Reflex save
      negates this effect.

      </p>

      <p>Creatures benefiting from Stability or Personal Gravity, such as an
      elocater, gain a +4 bonus to their saving throw.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> This power may be augmented in one or both of
      the following ways.

      </p><ol><li>By spending an additional 2 power points, ranged attacks, but
      not ranged touch attacks, fired at nearby targets are likely to veer off
      course, turning toward the creature affected. Any ranged attack within 10
      ft. that misses its target has a 25% chance of striking at the creature
      affected. Roll a second attack roll at a -4 penalty with the affected
      creature as the target. If the attack roll is successful, the affected
      creature is struck by the ranged attack.</li><li>For every 4 additional
      power points spent, the distance from the target increases by 5 ft. to
      determine if a missed attack strikes at the affected creature.</li></ol>
