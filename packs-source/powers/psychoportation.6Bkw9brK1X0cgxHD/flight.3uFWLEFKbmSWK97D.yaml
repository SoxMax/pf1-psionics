      <p>You can fly at a speed of 60 feet (or 40 feet if you wear medium or
      heavy armor, or if you carry a medium or heavy load). You can ascend at
      half speed and descend at double speed, and your maneuverability is good.
      Using this power requires only as much concentration as walking, so you
      can attack or manifest normally. You can charge but not run, and you
      cannot carry aloft more weight than your maximum load, plus any armor you
      wear. You gain a bonus on Fly skill checks equal to 1/2 your manifester
      level.

      </p>

      <p>Should the duration expire while you are still aloft, the power fails
      slowly. You float downward 60 feet per round for 1d6 rounds. If you reach
      the ground in that amount of time, you lands safely. If not, you fall the
      rest of the distance, taking 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet of fall.
      Since dispelling a power effectively ends it, you also descend safely in
      this way if the power is dispelled, but not if it is negated by a null
      psionics field.
