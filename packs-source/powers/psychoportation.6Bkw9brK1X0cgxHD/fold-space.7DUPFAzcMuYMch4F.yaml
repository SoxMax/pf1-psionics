      <p>You instantly transfer yourself from your current location to any other
      spot within range. You always arrive at exactly the spot desired—whether
      by simply visualizing the area or by stating direction. After using this
      power, you can't take any other actions until your next turn. You can
      bring along objects as long as their weight doesn't exceed your maximum
      load. You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature
      (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent per
      three manifester levels. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures,
      a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth. All creatures
      to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of
      those creatures must be in contact with you.

      </p>

      <p>If you arrive in a place that is already occupied by a solid body, you
      and each creature traveling with you take 1d6 points of damage and are
      shunted to a random open space on a suitable surface within 100 feet of
      the intended location.

      </p>

      <p>If there is no free space within 100 feet, you and each creature
      traveling with you take an additional 2d6 points of damage and are shunted
      to a free space within 1,000 feet. If there is no free space within 1,000
      feet, you and each creature travelling with you take an additional 4d6
      points of damage and the power simply fails.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> If you spend 6 additional power points, you
      can manifest this power as a move action, although you still cannot take
      any other actions until your next turn.
