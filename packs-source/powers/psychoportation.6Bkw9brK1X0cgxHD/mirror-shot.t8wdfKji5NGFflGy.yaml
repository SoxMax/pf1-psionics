    value: >-
      <p>You draw upon your psionic might to mirror the potential paths of a
      projectile into this reality, psionically turning a lone arrow into an
      entire volley, or a thrown dagger into a deadly hail of knives.

      </p>

      <p>You can manifest this power with a moment's thought, quick enough to
      use when it is not your turn. You must manifest this power in response to
      a single attack made with a ranged weapon within medium range (the
      attacker must be within range, the target need not be) before the result
      of the attack is determined. You cannot use this power to mirror unusually
      massive projectiles such as siege weapons.

      </p>

      <p>You create four reflections of the projectile that each do damage as a
      mundane weapon of the original projectile's type. Each mirrored projectile
      uses the same attack roll result as the reflected attack to determine if
      they strike the target or not (regardless of their enhancement bonus to
      attack), and each projectile checks for concealment individually. Effects
      that modify the weapon or its damage, such as that from Psionic Shot or
      prevenom weapon, do not apply to these reflections.

      </p>

      <p>If applicable, the projectiles add the Strength bonus of the original
      attacker under the normal constraints for the attacker's weapon (full
      strength bonus for thrown weapons, full strength bonus up to a certain
      value for composite longbows, etc). The reflections return to their native
      reality shortly after appearing and cannot be preserved.

      </p>

      <p>Precision damage (such as sneak attack) and extra damage from critical
      hits only apply to the first projectile fired, not to the four
      reflections. The four mirrored projectiles bypass damage reduction as
      though they were magic weapons.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> You may augment this power in one or more of
      the following ways:

      </p><ol><li>By spending additional power points, you may reflect
      enhancement bonuses or magic abilities of the initial projectile. For
      every 2 additional power points you spend, you may bestow the reflections
      with the equivalent of an additional +1 enhancement bonus or ability
      priced as a +1 bonus. Reflecting abilities that add a flat sum to the
      price of the weapon cost 1 additional power point per 5000 gp of their
      market price to replicate. Like standard magical weapons, you may not add
      abilities to the reflection projectiles unless they already have at least
      a +1 enhancement bonus. The enhancement bonus or ability to be added must
      exist on the original projectile.</li><li>For every 4 additional power
      points you spend, you may create an additional projectile.</li><li>If you
      spend 10 additional power points, you may use this power to reflect
      unusually massive projectiles such as siege weapons or boulders hurled by
      giants. All reflections strike the same area, if applicable.</li></ol>
