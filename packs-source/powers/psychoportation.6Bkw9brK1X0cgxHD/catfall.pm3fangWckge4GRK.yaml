      <p>You recover instantly from a fall and can absorb some damage from
      falling. You land on your feet no matter how far you fall, and you take
      damage as if the fall were [[50 + 50 * @augments.amplify]] feet shorter
      than it actually is. This power affects you and anything you carry or hold
      (up to your maximum load). You can manifest this power with an instant
      thought, quickly enough to gain the benefit of the power while you fall.
      You can manifest this power even when it isn't your
      turn.</p><p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every additional power point you
      spend, this power reduces your damage as if the fall were an additional 50
      feet shorter.</p>
