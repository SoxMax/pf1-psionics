      <p>You recover instantly from a fall and can absorb some damage from
      falling. You land on your feet no matter how far you fall, and you take
      damage as if the fall were 50 feet shorter than it actually is. This power
      affects you and anything you carry or hold (up to your maximum load). You
      can manifest this power with an instant thought, quickly enough to gain
      the benefit of the power while you fall. You

      can manifest this power even when it isn't your turn.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every additional power point you spend,
      this power reduces your damage as if the fall were an additional 50 feet
      shorter.
