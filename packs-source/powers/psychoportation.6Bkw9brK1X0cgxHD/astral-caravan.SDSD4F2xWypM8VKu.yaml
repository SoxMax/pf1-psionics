      <p>You lead a caravan into the Astral Plane, leaving the Material Plane
      behind. Since the Astral Plane touches upon other planes, you can travel
      astrally to any of these other planes as you wish, but only if you know
      your way (see below).

      </p>

      <p>You can bring other willing creatures with you, provided that these
      subjects have each manifested
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1-psionics.powers.Item.oQkE1yy703zGusPb]{Astral
      Traveler} and are linked hand to hand with you at the time of the astral
      caravan's manifestation. These fellow travelers are dependent upon you and
      must accompany you at all times. If something happens to you during the
      journey that causes you to break hand-to-hand contact, your companions are
      stranded wherever you leave them. Because the planes are a dangerous
      place, those who lead astral caravans usually choose to manifest this
      power only if they have a large party of travelers assembled. Sometimes
      groups of lowerlevel adventurers may hire you to lead forays beyond the
      Material Plane.

      </p>

      <p>The astral caravan power lasts while you and your fellow travelers
      maintain your original formation, until (1) you reach your intended
      destination plane, (2) you desire to end the power while still traversing
      the Astral Plane, (3) you or anyone traveling with you breaks the
      hand-to-hand chain connecting the travelers for 2 consecutive rounds, or
      (4) the power is terminated by some outside means, such as dispel
      psionics. When the power ends, you and your fellow travelers halt in
      whatever portion of the Astral Plane you happen to be traversing (the
      Astral Plane is in many ways subjective in location; in any event, one
      place on the Astral looks much like any other).

      </p>

      <p>While you are traveling through the Astral Plane, those natives who
      happen to glimpse you and your fellow travelers perceive you to be moving
      at a speed of 30 feet (you can't run), with you flying in the lead and
      your fellow travelers strung out behind you, each linked to the next by
      one hand.

      </p>

      <p>Depending on your knowledge of the planes, your journey through the
      subjective space that is the Astral Plane may take a longer or shorter
      period of time. For each 24 hours you travel, make a Knowledge (planes)
      check. Unless a location is particularly hard to find and well guarded, or
      conversely easy to find and well advertised, the average DC for an astral
      caravan journey should be set at 20. You cannot take 20 on this check,
      though you can take 10. Each check may be modified by your degree of
      familiarity with the destination or by some connection you have with the
      place; see the following tables.

      </p>

      <p>Each successful check indicates that you are one step closer to your
      goal. To finally arrive at your location, you must succeed on six checks
      within a span of 12 days. (If you fail to make six successful checks
      within the first 12 days, you can continue to make one check per day until
      you get the requisite six successes within a span of 12 consecutive days).
      When you successfully make the requisite number of checks, the journey
      ends, and you appear on your chosen plane within 10–1,000 (1d% x 10) miles
      of your intended destination on that plane.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> If you spend 2 additional power points, this
      power weaves a quasi-real filmy membrane around yourself and all those
      adjacent to each other in the caravan (being linked by hand is not
      required if this membrane is used). You remain visible within the
      translucent, amorphous enclosure. You can pick up or drop willing
      passengers, easily reaching through the film. Anything you hold is
      enveloped by the film. Any attacks made through the enclosure in either
      direction have a 25% miss chance due to the rippling membrane.

      </p>

      <p>When you manifest this power in its augmented form, your apparent speed
      to those observing on the Astral Plane is 40 feet, and you can make a
      Knowledge (planes) check once every 12 hours to attempt to make it to your
      destination (six successful checks within 12 consecutive days still sees
      you to your desired goal).
