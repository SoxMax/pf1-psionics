          Diverts the teleportation of any object or creature whose weight does
          not exceed your maximum load
  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Similar to detect teleportation, except that you know the intended
      destination, and you can divert the final destination of any teleportation
      attempt made by others within the area.

      </p>

      <p>You can divert the destination of both incoming and outgoing
      teleportations, psionic and magical. You must overcome the power
      resistance of creatures that possess it to make a successful diversion,
      and the teleporting creature can make a Will save to foil the diversion as
      well.

      </p>

      <p>For the purpose of this power, "divert" means you choose the actual
      destination of any teleportation attempt you can affect, as if you
      yourself were teleporting to that location, regardless of the
      teleportation range of the effect you are diverting. The destination you
      choose must be a location with which you are very familiar or that you
      have studied carefully.
