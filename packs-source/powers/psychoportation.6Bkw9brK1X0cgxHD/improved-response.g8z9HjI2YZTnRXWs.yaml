    value: >-
      <p>You accelerate the reaction time of the target, allowing them to take
      this round's actions ahead of the creature who would have otherwise gone
      immediately before the target. If this would place the target before you
      and he has not already taken this round's actions, the target must
      immediately take this round's actions. If the target has already taken
      this round's actions, the power affects them on the next round.

      </p>

      <p>A creature may only be affected by this power once per round. This
      power does not allow a creature to act in a round if he would not normally
      be allowed to (such as during the surprise round).

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every additional 6 power points spent,
      the target's place in the initiative order is improved by one additional
      step.
