      <p>This power functions like ethereal form, except that you and other
      willing creatures joined by linked hands (along with their equipment)
      become ethereal. Besides yourself, you can bring one creature per three
      manifester levels to the Ethereal Plane. Once ethereal, the subjects need
      not stay together.

      </p>

      <p>When the power expires, all affected creatures on the Ethereal Plane
      return to material existence.

      </p>

      <p>If you end the power or the power ends normally and any of the affected
      creatures including you become material while inside a material object
      (such as a solid wall), that creature or creatures are shunted off to the
      nearest open space and take 1d6 points of damage per 5 feet shunted.
