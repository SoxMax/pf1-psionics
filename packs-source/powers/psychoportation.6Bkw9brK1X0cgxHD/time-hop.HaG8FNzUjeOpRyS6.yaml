    value: >-
      <p>The subject of the power hops forward in time 1 round for every
      manifester level you have. In effect, the subject seems to disappear in a
      shimmer of silver energy, then reappear after the duration of this power
      expires. The subject reappears in exactly the same orientation and
      condition as before. From the subject's point of view, no time has passed
      at all.

      </p>

      <p>In each round of the power's duration, on what would have been the
      subject's turn, it can attempt a DC 15 Wisdom check. Success allows the
      subject to return. The subject can act normally on its next turn after
      this power ends.

      </p>

      <p>If the space from which the subject departed is occupied upon his
      return to the time stream, he appears in the closest unoccupied space,
      still in his original orientation. Determine the closest space randomly if
      necessary.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> You can augment this power in one or both of
      the following ways.

      </p><ol><li>For every 2 additional power points you spend, you can affect
      a creature of one size category larger, or double the weight of an object
      to be affected.</li><li>For every 2 additional power points you spend,
      this power can affect an additional target. Any additional target cannot
      be more than 15 feet from another target of the power.</li></ol>
