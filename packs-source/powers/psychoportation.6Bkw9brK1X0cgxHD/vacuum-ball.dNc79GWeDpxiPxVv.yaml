  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A skin of force abruptly surrounds your foe, then the environment
      within changes to mimic the hostile space between worlds. When you target
      a creature with this power, you transport the atmosphere and environment
      that surrounds them to space, leaving behind an area of vacuum. An
      affected creature immediately takes 3d6 points of damage from sudden
      decompression. Additionally, the area within a <em>vacuum ball </em>does
      not support the transmission of sound, so is treated as if under the
      effects of <em>silence</em>. Finally, a creature within a <em>vacuum ball
      </em>begins suffocating if they need to breathe.

      </p>

      <p>A creature cannot escape from a <em>vacuum ball </em>by means of
      movement; the hostile area follows them as they move. This does not
      prevent escape by means of psychoportive travel such as <em>fold
      space</em>. If a creature does manage to escape the confines of a
      <em>vacuum ball</em>, the power immediately ends.

      </p>

      <p>The membrane surrounding a <em>vacuum ball </em>is semipermeable,
      allowing the surrounded creature to act normally in most ways. They are
      still able to make melee and ranged attacks (though items and abilities
      relying on air such as firearms may not function). Fire does not function
      within a <em>vacuum ball</em>, so carried torches will be immediately
      extinguished, but this does not interfere with powers with a duration of
      instantaneous from harming a creature within if they deal fire damage. A
      <em>flaming </em>weapon is suppressed while its wielder is within a
      <em>vacuum ball</em>.

      </p>

      <p><em><strong>Mythic Vacuum Ball</strong></em></p>

      <p>A creature within the confines of a <em>mythic vacuum ball </em>takes
      an additional 3d6 points of damage each round that you maintain
      concentration. After five rounds of being contained with a <em>mythic
      vacuum ball</em>, such a creature’s blood vessels begin to rupture. Such a
      creature must make a Fortitude save (DC same as the power’s) or become
      temporarily blind. This blindness ends two rounds after this power ends.
