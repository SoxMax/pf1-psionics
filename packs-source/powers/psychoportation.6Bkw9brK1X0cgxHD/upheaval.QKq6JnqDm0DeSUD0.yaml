    value: >-
      <p>You translocate entire chunks of the earth 50 ft. into the air, where
      they fall onto the targets below. Each creature in the area affected takes
      9d6 points of bludgeoning damage as the earth falls back to the ground.
      Unlike normal damage from powers, this damage is subject to damage
      reduction that would affect mundane bludgeoning damage.

      </p>

      <p>In addition, the ground in the affected area becomes difficult terrain,
      making movement through it harder.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For each additional 2 power points spent,
      this power can affect an area 5 ft. larger in radius and the save DC
      increases by 1.
