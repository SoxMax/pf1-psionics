      <p><em>You ever-hungry psionic scar holds greater demands for greater
      power.</em></p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Con 13;
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1-psionics.feats.Item.14jCelSdW3Lz8pfH]{Psionic Body}
      or <a rel="nofollow" class="external text"

      @UUID[Compendium.pf1-psionics.feats.Item.1pJiRQTsLeckXqrQ]{Warrior's
      Focus}; warrior's path class feature, manifester level 10th, base attack
      bonus +6.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit: </strong>The hunger path’s trance causes those who
      fail a saving throw against your powers or class abilities to become
      sickened for two rounds from the power of your aura. When using the
      maneuver, the ranged touch attack not only draws in psychic power, but it
      also life energies. In addition to the power point drain, the attack
      inflicts 1d6 points of damage at 3rd level, and this damage improves by
      1d6 points of damage at 7th level and every four levels thereafter. You
      gain 5 temporary hit points for 10 points of damage inflicted by this
      attack. These temporary hit points last for one minute or until they are
      taken away by damage; further applications of this ability do not stack up
      additional temporary hit points. This feat is a supernatural ability.
