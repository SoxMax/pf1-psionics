  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You have learned how to better handle psychic

      enervation.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite: </strong>Psychic enervation class feature.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit: </strong>When you suffer psychic enervation, the

      penalties are calculated as if your wilder level were

      reduced by half (to a minimum of 1).

      </p>

      <p><br /></p>

      <p>You are extremely resilient against psychic enervation.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Enervation Fortitude.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When you suffer psychic enervation, you do
      not lose any hit points or power points, although you still suffer any
      additional effects like being stunned or sickened. In addition, you can
      expend one use of mythic power when you would suffer psychic enervation to
      negate the psychic enervation and instead gain surging euphoria.
