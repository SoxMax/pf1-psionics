      <p><em>You can leave an imprint behind for as long as you wish, for you to
      retreat to later.</em></p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Afterimage class feature, rewind
      parallel action.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit: </strong>As a full-round action, you can set a
      semi-permanent afterimage on your current location. You can use rewind to
      return to this location instead of one of your normal afterimages as long
      as you are within a certain range of it, based on your character level
      (see below). This afterimage lasts until you rewind to it, or until you
      set another afterimage using this feat. This ability cannot cross planar
      boundaries; it only functions if you are still on the same plane as the
      bookmark.
