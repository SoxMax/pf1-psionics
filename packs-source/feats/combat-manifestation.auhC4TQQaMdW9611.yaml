  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You are adept at manifesting powers in combat.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit: </strong>You get a +4 bonus on concentration checks

      made to manifest a power or use a psi-like ability when

      manifesting on the defensive or while grappled.

      </p>

      <p><br /></p>

      <p>You rarely lose concentration in combat.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Combat Manifestation.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> The bonus from Combat Manifestation increases
      to +8. Anytime you fail a concentration check, you do not lose the power
      points you were attempting to use. You do not manage to manifest the
      power, but the power points remains available for you to use at a later
      time. Additionally if you successfully make a check to manifest a power
      defensively and the power requires a ranged attack roll, that ranged
      attack does not provoke an attack of opportunity.
