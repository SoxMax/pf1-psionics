    value: >-
      <p>Your vicious attacks wound your foe.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite: </strong>Base attack bonus +8.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit: </strong>To use this feat, you must expend your

      psionic focus. You can make an attack with such vicious

      force that you wound your opponent. A wound deals 1

      point of Constitution damage to your foe in addition to

      the usual damage dealt.

      </p>

      <p>You must decide whether or not to use this feat prior to

      making an attack. If your attack misses, you still expend

      your psionic focus.

      </p>

      <p><br /></p>

      <p>Your attacks are particularly debilitating.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Wounding Attack.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> The Constitution damage dealt from Wounding
      Attack is doubled. In addition, you can expend a use of mythic power as a
      swift action when an attack made with Wounding Attack misses to reroll the
      attack roll. 

      </p>
