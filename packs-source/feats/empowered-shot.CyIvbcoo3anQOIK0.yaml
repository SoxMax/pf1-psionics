      Shot</a>.

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> As long as you maintain psionic focus, the
      range of your ranged weapons doubles. You may expend your psionic focus as
      part of a ranged attack (but not ranged touch attack) to ignore any
      penalties for range increment for that single attack. That attack still
      has its range doubled as if you were maintaining psionic focus.
