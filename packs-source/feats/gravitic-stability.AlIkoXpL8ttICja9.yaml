    value: |-
      <p>You have an uncanny stability against attempts to
      impede your movement.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Prerequisites: </strong>Elocater level 1st
      </p>
      <p><strong>Benefit: </strong>Any time your movement speed would be
      reduced to 10 ft. as a result of using personal gravity
      or scorn earth (such as from wearing heavy armor or
      being more than 1 ft. away from a stable surface), your
      speed is instead reduced to 10 ft. plus any bonuses to
      your movement (such as from freerunning). You do not
      take any penalty for attacking while using scorn earth at
      distances greater than 1 ft. from the ground or a stable
      surface. You gain a bonus to your CMD equal to your
      elocater class level against any bull rush or trip attempt.
