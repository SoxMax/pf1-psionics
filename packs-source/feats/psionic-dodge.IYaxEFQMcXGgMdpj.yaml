    value: >-
      <p>You are proficient at dodging blows.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite: </strong>Dex 13, Dodge.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit: </strong>You must be psionically focused to use this

      feat. You receive a +1 dodge bonus to your Armor Class.

      This bonus stacks with the bonus from the Dodge feat.

      You may expend your psionic focus as an immediate

      action to increase this bonus to a +4 dodge bonus to your

      Armor Class for a single attack made against you.

      </p>

      <p><br /></p>

      <p>Your psionically-empowered reflexes are heightened by your mythic
      power.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Psionic Dodge.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> The dodge bonus you gain from Psionic Dodge
      is doubled. In addition, when an attack against you misses, you can expend
      a use of mythic power as an immediate action to take a 5-foot step
