      <p><em>You've become more like the undead that you spend so much time
      with.</em></p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Must be living.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You gain a +2 bonus on all saving throws
      against pain and cold effects (including effects that deal cold damage and
      allow a save) however your skin becomes ice cold and your complexion
      sallow and sunken. You suffer a -4 penalty on Disguise checks to pose as
      anything living.

      </p>
