      <p><em>You've broadened your methods of conscripting enemies.</em></p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Conscription class feature.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit: </strong>When you take this feat, you choose a method
      of conscription from a different set of highlord tenets. By expending your
      psionic focus as a free action, even if it isn't your turn, you may use
      the conscription ability of that tenet as if you were a highlord of that
      tenet for a round.
