  description:
    value: >-
      <p><em>You make a combination of quick strikes, sacrificing accuracy for
      multiple, minor wounds that prove exceptionally deadly.</em></p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf1.feats.Item.vWiTqHC4Y3Xn1Pme]{Weapon
      Finesse}, base attack bonus +1.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When wielding a light weapon, you can choose
      to take a -1 penalty on all melee attack rolls and combat maneuver checks
      to gain a +2 bonus on all melee damage rolls. This bonus to damage is
      halved (-50%) if you are making an attack with an off-hand weapon or
      secondary natural weapon. When your base attack bonus reaches +4, and for
      every 4 points thereafter, the penalty increases by -1 and the bonus on
      damage rolls increases by +2. You must choose to use this feat before the
      attack roll, and its effects last until your next turn. The bonus damage
      does not apply to touch attacks or effects that do not deal hit point
      damage. This feat cannot be used in conjunction with the
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.feats.Item.FUW5mIXHNBBIQ1Sq]{Power Attack} feat.

      </p><ul><li><em><strong>See:</strong><a href="/wiki/Combat_Stamina"
      title="Combat Stamina">Combat Stamina</a></em>.</li></ul>

      <p>When using this feat, you can spend 2 stamina points to gain the
      benefits and the hindrances of that feat until the end of your turn,
      instead of until your next turn.
