      <p><em>You can combine energy types in your powers.</em></p>

      <p><strong>Benefit: </strong>To use this feat, you must expend your
      psionic focus. When you manifest a power that deals cold, electricity,
      fire, or sonic damage using this feat, choose an additional energy type.
      The power counts as being both energy types and only the lowest resistance
      works against the admixed power. Using this feat increases the power point
      cost of the power by 2. The power’s total cost cannot exceed your
      manifester level.
