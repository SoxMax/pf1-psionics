      <p><em>You increase your manifesting ability by penalizing the manifesting and spellcasting ability of members of your collective.</em></p>
      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Collective class feature, @UUID[Compendium.pf1-psionics.feats.Item.lPBKCtxFvagvrV6T]{Mind Parasite}.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Benefit: </strong>For short moments at a time, you can drain power from those in your Collective to enhance yourself. Up to 3 times per day, as a swift action, you can give every member of your Collective a –1 penalty to their caster or manifester level and gain a +1 bonus per affected member to your manifester level. This penalty does not
      apply to members of your collective without a caster or manifester level. Members of the collective with both a spellcaster level and manifester level may choose which
      receives the penalty. This increase does not allow you to augment powers beyond your regular manifester level, but affects your ability to add metapsionic effects, as
      well as all other aspects of manifesting a power such as range, duration, overcoming power resistance, and the like. Both the penalty and bonus last for a number of
      rounds equal to your key ability modifier.
