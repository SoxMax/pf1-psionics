    value: >-
      <p>You can attune your mind to the subtle inner workings

      of other psionic beings, and gain a more intimate

      knowledge of their powers.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites: </strong>Collective class feature, Spellcraft 3

      ranks.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit: </strong>To use this feat, you must have an active

      collective when you choose your powers known for the

      day or meditate to regain your power point pool. Choose

      a number of powers equal to your primary manifesting

      modifier that members of your collective know. If you

      are psionically focused, you may treat those powers

      as if they were on your power list for the purposes of

      manifesting another’s powers known. You may change

      these powers as often as you change your powers known

      or regain your power point pool.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Special: </strong>The nature of this connection requires

      constant focus. If you expend your focus during the

      manifestation (for instance, to add a metapsionic feat

      to a borrowed power), the manifestation fails. If you

      have the Psicrystal Containment feat, you can expend

      your crystal’s focus and maintain your own, and the

      manifestation will not fail in this way.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Normal: </strong>If you try to manifest a power that is not

      on your power list from another’s powers known, the

      attempt automatically fails.

      </p>

      <p>You are able to learn powers from members in your collective.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Harmonic Resonance.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When selecting powers from those known by
      members of your collective, you can choose to have those powers as your
      powers known, instead of as powers you can use for the purposes of
      manifesting another’s powers known. Powers selected in this way only stay
      as powers known until you meditate to regain power points, at which point
      you can choose new powers from members of your collective. Powers chosen
      must have a power level equal to or lower than the maximum power level you
      can manifest. In addition, you can expend one use of mythic power to
      manifest a single power from those known by any member of your collective
      without having to pay the power point cost. The power manifested in this
      fashion is automatically augmented up to your manifester level.
