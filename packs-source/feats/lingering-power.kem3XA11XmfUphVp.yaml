      <p><em>You can delay the effect of a power on the target.</em></p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong><a href="/wiki/Delay_Power" title="Delay
      Power">Delay Power</a>, Manifester level 5th.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit: </strong>To use this feat, you must expend your
      psionic focus. You manifest a psionic power that targets a single creature
      and can choose to have it linger instead of taking effect immediately.
      Activating a lingering power takes a standard action and you have to be
      able to see the target, at which the power takes effect as if you had just
      manifest it. Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power
      by 4, in which case it lingers for an hour, or by 8, in which case it
      lingers for a day. The power’s total cost cannot exceed your manifester
      level.
