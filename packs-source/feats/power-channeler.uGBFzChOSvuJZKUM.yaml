    value: |-
      <p>You have learned how to channel your powers through
      your weaponry, allowing you to make melee attacks and
      channel offensive powers at the same time.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Benefit: </strong>You can channel a touch range power
      through a melee weapon. You can make a single melee
      attack during the same action in which you manifest a
      touch power with a manifesting time of one standard
      action; if this melee attack hits, it triggers the power as if
      you had succeeded on a touch attack and deals damage
      as normal. If you miss, the power fizzles and the charge
      is lost. The attack made is against standard AC and not
      touch AC.
