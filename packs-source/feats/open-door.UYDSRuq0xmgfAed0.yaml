    value: |-
      <p>Once you have pried the gates open into another mind,
      you can always return there no matter how long it has
      been.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Prerequisite: </strong>Mindlock class feature.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Benefit: </strong>Once an individual has failed a Will save to
      avoid being mindlocked by you, you can attune yourself
      to that creature. You can only be attuned to one creature
      in such a way at any given time. You can reactivate
      the mindlock to your attuned creature at any time by
      spending 1 power point as a free action, regardless of
      the time since you first mindlocked the target. This
      means that they count as having failed their Will save
      again.
