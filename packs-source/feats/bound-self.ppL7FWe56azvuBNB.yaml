      <p><em>As a last-ditch effort, you may bind your own soul to your
      psicrystal – preventing death at great cost.</em></p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf1-psionics.feats.Item.y4s3owml0O47McPR]{Bound
      Spirit},
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1-psionics.feats.Item.pwkovU22CjU6Z5kN]{Psicrystal
      Affinity},
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1-psionics.feats.Item.pxNrNohrBxV4H5Hi]{Spirited
      Psicrystal}, manifester level 15th.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> While on the edge of death, you can bind a
      piece of yourself into your <a href="/wiki/Psicrystal"
      title="Psicrystal">psicrystal</a> to be granted another chance. You may
      only use Bound Self if you currently have an active psicrystal. You may
      expend your psionic focus and gain two permanent negative levels to use
      one of the following abilities:

      </p>

      <p>You may use Bound Self when you would fail a save against an effect
      that would instantly kill you to automatically succeed on the save.

      </p>

      <p>You may use Bound Self when you would suffer enough damage to kill you
      to instead only suffer enough damage to reduce you to 0 hit points.

      </p>

      <p>You may use Bound Self when you would be reduced to a Constitution
      score of 0 to instead be reduced to a Constitution score of 1.

      </p>

      <p>If your psicrystal is destroyed while you possess any negative levels
      gained from Bound Self, you must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC equal to
      10 + your manifester level) or die instantly.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> If you are immune to negative levels, you may
      not benefit from this feat.

      </p>
