      <p><em>You can draw on the members of your collective to gain nourishment
      and to grant yourself abilities.</em></p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Collective class feature.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:&#160;</strong>As long as you have the maximum number
      of members in your collective for at least 24 hours, you do not need to
      eat or drink for as long as those members remain in the collective. In
      addition, up to 3 times per day, as a swift action, you can gain 1
      temporary hit point per member of your collective. These temporary hit
      points stack with themselves.

      </p>
