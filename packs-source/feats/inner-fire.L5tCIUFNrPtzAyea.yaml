    value: >-
      <p><em>You use psionic power to augment your rampaging elemental
      abilities.</em></p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Gather power class feature.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You can expend your psionic focus while
      gathering power to reduce the action needed to alleviate burn. If you take
      a swift action, you are treated as if you had gathered power as a move
      action. If you take a move action, you are treated as if you gathered
      power for a full round. You cannot gather power in another way in the same
      turn you use this feat.

      </p>
