    value: >-
      <p><em>You imbue your body with the essence of speed, psionically
      enhancing your movements.</em></p>

      <p><strong>Benefit: </strong>You can psionically focus your body in the
      same manner in which you gain psionic focus normally. At any time when you
      need to expend your psionic focus on an ability that is normally taken
      during movement or would change your location (including both movement and
      teleportation), you can expend this psionic focus instead. At any time
      when you need to maintain psionic focus with such an ability, you can use
      this psionic focus instead. Psionically focusing with this feat works just
      like focusing your own mind.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Special: </strong>You cannot benefit from this feat at the same
      time as <a href="/wiki/Psicrystal_Containment" title="Psicrystal
      Containment">Psicrystal Containment</a>, <a href="/wiki/Deep_Focus"
      title="Deep Focus">Deep Focus</a>, or another ability that grants you an
      extra psionic focus. If you have more than one of these, you may only have
      a single additional psionic focus at any given time.
