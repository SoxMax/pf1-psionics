      <p><em>The primary target of a chained power takes extra damage for each
      subsequent target who takes damage.</em></p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong><a href="/wiki/Chain_Power" title="Chain
      Power">Chain Power</a>.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When using the Chain Power feat, the chains
      create an arcing feedback loop, which means that for every secondary chain
      target that is damaged, the original target takes additional damage equal
      to the minimum damage the original power could cause (for example, an Acid
      Energy Ray that would deal 5d6 acid damage would deal 5 acid damage to the
      original target for each secondary target).
