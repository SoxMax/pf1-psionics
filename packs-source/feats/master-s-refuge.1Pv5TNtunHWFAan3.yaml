      <p>Your thralls are also your final resort if death comes
      calling.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Prerequisite: </strong>Twofold master class feature
      </p>
      <p><strong>Benefit: </strong>When you die, your mind instantly transfers
      to one of your living thralls. While inside your thrall, their
      mind submerges into a comatose state and you take over
      their body. You retain the body’s Strength, Constitution
      and Dexterity, but you keep your Intelligence, Wisdom
      and Charisma, as well as all other relevant statistics.
      Each day you remain in your thralls body, you must
      make a Will-save or die (DC20 +1 for each day spent in
      the body). If your body is recreated, you can relocate
      to your body at will, or you can find alternate means of
      surviving (via the <em>mind switch </em>power, for example).
