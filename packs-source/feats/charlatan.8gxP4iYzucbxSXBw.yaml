      <p><em>You can fake out practitioners of magic when using your own
      superhuman abilities.</em></p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Bluff 1 rank, Spellcraft 1 rank.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Whenever you use a power, psi-like ability,
      spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability, you may make a Bluff
      or Spellcraft check to obfuscate the nature of your ability. A creature
      watching you while you use this ability must succeed at a Sense Motive or
      Spellcraft check with a DC equal to your Bluff check result or they
      believe that you used a type of effect of your choice from the above list.
      They do not gain insight into the exact nature of your ability; for
      example, you could fool a creature into thinking that you've cast a spell,
      but they will not be sure of what exact spell you've cast. If your ability
      has obvious components (such as verbal, somatic, or material components, a
      psionic power's display, or a dragon's breath weapon erupting from its
      mouth), then you take a –5 penalty on your Bluff check. A creature that
      succeeds on its check may still make a Spellcraft check to identify a
      spell or power being used, as normal.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> If your campaign uses <em><a
      href="/wiki/Path_of_War" title="Path of War">Path of War</a></em>, you may
      use this feat to obfuscate a supernatural martial maneuver, or to disguise
      one of the listed effects as a martial maneuver. If you do, you may make a
      Knowledge (martial) check in place of your Bluff or Spellcraft check, and
      viewers may attempt a Knowledge (martial) check in place of their Sense
      Motive or Spellcraft check. A maneuver does not have obvious components
      for the purposes of this feat.
