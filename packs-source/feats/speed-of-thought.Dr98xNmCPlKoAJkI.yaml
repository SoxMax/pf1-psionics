    value: >-
      <p>The energy of your mind energizes the alacrity of your

      body.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite: </strong>Wis 13.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit: </strong>As long as you are psionically focused and

      not wearing heavy armor, you gain an insight bonus

      to your speed of 10 feet.  You may expend your psionic

      focus to increase the insight bonus to your speed to 30

      feet for your turn.

      </p>

      <p><br /></p>

      <p>You are faster than the eye can see.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Speed of Thought.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Double the bonus to your speed from Speed of
      Thought. In addition, you can expend a use of mythic power when taking a
      5-foot step to instead move your full speed.
