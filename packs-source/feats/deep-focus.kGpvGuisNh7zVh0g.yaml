      <p>You have learned to focus your subconscious mind
      even while awake.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Prerequisites: </strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf1-psionics.feats.Item.14jCelSdW3Lz8pfH]{Psionic Body}, Autohypnosis 4 ranks.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Benefit: </strong>You can psionically focus your subconscious
      in the same manner in which you gain psionic focus
      normally. At any time when you need to expend your
      psionic focus, you can expend your subconscious’s
      psionic focus instead. At any time when you need
      to maintain psionic focus for an effect, you can use
      your subconscious’s psionic focus instead. Psionically
      focusing your subconscious works just like focusing
      your conscious mind.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Special: </strong>You cannot benefit from both Psicrystal
      Containment and Deep Focus at the same time. If you
      have both feats, you may only have your psicrystal or
      your subconscious maintaining psionic focus at any
      given time.
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p>Your subconscious mind’s focus is improved.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Deep Focus.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> As long as you have at least one use of mythic power remaining or one power point remaining in your power point pool, you are always treated as if you are maintaining psionic focus for abilities powered by maintaining psionic focus. You may still only expend your psionic focus if you are actually maintaining psionic focus. In addition, you can expend a use of mythic power as a swift action to regain both your own and the psionic focus provided by Deep Focus.
