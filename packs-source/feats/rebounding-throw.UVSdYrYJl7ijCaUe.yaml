      <p><em>Your thrown attacks are capable of mowing down multiple enemies
      with a single throw.</em></p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong><a href="/wiki/Rebounding_Throw"
      title="Rebounding Throw">Rebounding Throw</a>.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When you use Rebounding Throw, you may
      rebound the attack to a number of additional targets equal to half your
      mythic tier (minimum 1.) Each rebound adds a cumulative -2 penalty to the
      next attack. You cannot strike the same creature twice when using
      Rebounding Throw. If you expend one use of mythic power while using
      Rebounding Throw, the additional attacks are made at the full attack bonus
      and there are no penalties for range increments.
