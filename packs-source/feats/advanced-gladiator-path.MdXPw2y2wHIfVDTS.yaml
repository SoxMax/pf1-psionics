      <p><em>You’ve developed keen tactical instincts and are able to leverage

      @UUID[Compendium.pf1-psionics.feats.Item.JvPqfkAGFDSb2x62]{Ready
      Response}; warrior’s path class feature, manifester level 10th, base
      attack bonus +6.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit: </strong>The gladiator path trance ability allows you
      to tactically reposition yourself whenever you fail a combat maneuver
      attempt against an enemy or an enemy fails a combat maneuver attempt
      against you, allowing you to move up to 5 feet as a free action without
      provoking attacks of opportunity (even if it isn’t your turn). You may use
      the maneuver of this warrior’s path as part of an attack action you have
      made as a free action once per round. You must expend your psionic focus
      and you may immediately make a combat maneuver attempt (such as a disarm
      or grapple) as part of that attack action. This feat is a supernatural
      ability.
