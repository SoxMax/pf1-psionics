      <p><em>The pain of your collective reinvigorates you.</em></p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Collective class feature, character
      level 5th.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Whenever another member of your collective
      takes damage, you may expend your psionic focus as an immediate action in
      order to gain temporary hit points equal to half the damage dealt. These
      temporary hit points fade at a rate of 1 per round, and stack with
      temporary hit points gained from this feat. You may only gain temporary
      hit points in this way to a limit of up to half of your normal maximum hit
      points.

      </p>
