    value: >-
      <p>You are especially skilled at creating astral constructs.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite: </strong>Able to manifest <em><a>astral
      construct</a></em>.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit: </strong>You gain additional menu options for astral

      constructs, as detailed below.

      </p>

      <p><em><strong>Menu A</strong></em></p><ul><li><strong>Armor Spikes (Ex):
      </strong>The construct’s body is covered in spikes, allowing the construct
      to deal an extra 1d6 points of piercing damage with a successful trample,
      constrict, bull rush, or grapple attack. The construct also can make a
      regular melee attack with the spikes, dealing 1d6 points of
      damage.</li><li><strong>Dodge (Ex): </strong>The astral construct gains
      the Dodge feat even if it does not meet the
      prerequisites.</li><li><strong>Psionic Attacks (Su): </strong>The astral
      construct’s attacks are treated as psionic for the purposes of overcoming
      damage reduction.</li><li><strong>Might (Ex): </strong>The astral
      construct’s melee attacks deal an additional +1 point of
      damage.</li><li><strong>Talons (Ex): </strong>The astral construct
      replaces its slam attacks with claw attacks that deal either slashing or
      piercing damage, chosen at time of manifestation.</li><li><strong>Utility
      (Ex): </strong>Your construct can perform tasks for you. This can include
      such tasks as cleaning, cooking, or setting up camp, or any other activity
      that requires a DC 10 or lower skill check. An astral construct with this
      option does not need to stay close to the manifester and will continue
      following any given order until given other instructions. You can select
      this menu option multiple times. Each time, the DC of skill checks the
      construct can attempt increases by 2. An astral construct with this option
      that is not used in combat has a duration of 1 hour / level. If it later
      enters combat, its duration resets to 1 round / level, but suffers a -2
      penalty to its attack rolls.</li></ul>

      <p><em><strong>Menu B</strong></em></p><ul><li><strong>Great Cleave (Ex):
      </strong>The astral construct gains the Great Cleave feat even if it does
      not meet the prerequisites.</li><li><strong>Improved Might (Ex):
      </strong>The astral construct’s melee attacks deal an additional +3 points
      of damage. This does not stack with the Might menu
      option.</li><li><strong>Reach (Ex): </strong>The astral construct’s reach
      increases by 5 feet.</li><li><strong>Stunning Fist (Ex): </strong>The
      astral construct gains the Stunning Fist feat even if it does not meet the
      prerequisites. The construct can use Stunning Fist with its slam
      attack.</li></ul>

      <p><em><strong>Menu C</strong></em></p><ul><li><strong>Greater Might (Ex):
      </strong>The astral construct’s melee attacks deal an additional +5 points
      of damage. This does not stack with the Improved Might or Might menu
      option.</li><li><strong>Tail Slap (Ex): </strong>The astral construct
      gains a tail, giving it a tail slap secondary attack. A tail slap deals
      2d8 points of damage.</li></ul>
