      <p><em>The pyrokineticist has learned to split her focus and attack
      multiple targets at once.</em></p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Fire lash class feature, Knowledge
      (psionics) 10 ranks, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text"

      Focus</a> (whip)

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> By expending your psionic focus as part of a
      full attack, you can split you fire lash into two separate heads for the
      first attack. The fire lash returns to normal for the remaining attacks.
      Each head’s attack is rolled separately and need not be at the same
      target. If attacking multiple targets, these targets must be within 10 ft.
      of each other and both must be within 15 ft. of the pyrokineticist. Any
      extra damage dice that would have applied to the fire lash attack are
      applied to both heads, including damage from sources such as sneak attack
      and psychic strike.
