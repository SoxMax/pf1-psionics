      attack bonus +6

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit: </strong>When using the dervish trance, the competence
      bonus applies to your damage as well as your attack rolls. In addition,
      you can use the Dervish maneuver even if you moved before your attack and
      you have no limit of how many 5-foot steps you can take while using the
      Dervish maneuver, as long as you make at least one attack before each
      5-foot step. The maximum distance you can move in this round is that of a
      double move.
