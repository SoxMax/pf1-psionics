    value: >-
      <p><em>You can manifest a power that spreads among targets.</em></p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Manifester level 5th.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit: </strong>To use this feat, you must expend your
      psionic focus. When you manifest a power with a duration other than
      instantaneous or permanent, at any time during the duration, you can cause
      the power to affect an adjacent target as an immediate action. That target
      is affected as if you had just manifested the same power against the new
      target, including any augmentations used. You can cause a power to spread
      once for every five manifester levels you have. Using this feat increases
      the power point cost of the power by 2. The power’s total cost cannot
      exceed your manifester level.
