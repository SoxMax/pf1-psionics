    value: >-
      <p>You can manifest powers farther than normal.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit: </strong>To use this feat, you must expend your

      psionic focus. You can alter a power with a range of

      close, medium, or long to increase its range by 100%.

      An enlarged power with a range of close has a range of

      50 feet + 5 feet per level, a medium-range power has a

      range of 200 feet + 20 feet per level, and a long-range

      power has a range of 800 feet + 80 feet per level.

      Powers whose ranges are not defined by distance, as

      well as powers whose ranges are not close, medium, or

      long, are not affected.

      </p>

      <p>Using this feat does not increase the power point cost

      of the power.

      </p>

      <p><br /></p>

      <p>You can triple the range of a power.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Enlarge Power.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When you manifest a power with a range of
      close, medium, or long affected by Enlarge Power, its range is increased
      by +200%. An enlarged power with a range of close now has a range of 75
      ft. + 15 ft./2 levels, while medium-range powers have a range of 300 ft. +
      30 ft./level and long-range powers have a range of 1,200 ft. + 120
      ft./level. Alternatively, you may expend a use of mythic power to manifest
      a power as an enlarged power (gaining only the normal benefits of an
      enlarged power, rather than the increased benefits outlined above) without
      increasing the number of power points spent or expending psionic focus. 

      </p>

      <p><strong>Normal:</strong> An enlarged power with a range of close has a
      range of 50 ft. + 5 ft./level, while medium-range powers have a range of
      200 ft. + 20 ft./level and longrange powers have a range of 800 ft. + 80
      ft./level.
