      <p><em>You can use your psicrystal to take quick glimpses into the future.</em></p>
      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Psicrystal%20Affinity">@UUID[Compendium.pf1-psionics.feats.Item.pwkovU22CjU6Z5kN]{Psicrystal Affinity}</a>, character level 3rd.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Once per day, you may spend ten minutes divining the future using your psicrystal. When you do, roll a number of d20s equal to the highest of your Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma modifiers and record the results. As an immediate action, when you or another creature you can see within 60 feet rolls a d20, you may force them to use one of the recorded rolls instead of the result of their die roll, treating it in all ways as if they had rolled it. Using this ability expends the roll in question. An unwilling target can make a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + the highest of your Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma modifiers). If they succeed on their saving throw, they roll their die as normal, and the roll you tried to substitute is still expended. You may roll and record an additional d20 per day for every five character levels you possess. This feat is a supernatural ability.
