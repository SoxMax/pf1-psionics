    value: >-
      <p><em>Your manifesting includes glowing sigils.</em></p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> The ability to manifest a power.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit: </strong>Unlike most manifesters, you must draw
      glowing sigils either on the ground, in the air, or on your body to
      manifest a power, adding a “Somatic” component to your manifesting.
      However, these sigils bind your powers to this world and make them hard to
      resist, giving you a +1 bonus to save DCs and +2 to your manifester level
      to overcome power resistance.
