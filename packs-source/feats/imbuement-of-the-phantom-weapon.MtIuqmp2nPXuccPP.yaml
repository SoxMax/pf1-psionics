    value: |-
      <p>You have learned how to suspend a destructive psychic
      field on weapons other than your mind blade.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Ability to generate a mind blade,
      psychic strike +1d8.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Benefit</strong>: You may charge your psychic strike on a
      weapon other than your mind blade as if it were your
      mind blade and release it on a foe in the same manner.
      You may only maintain a number of charged weapons
      equal to the number of psychic strike dice you possess.
      If the charged weapon ever leaves your possession
      (either by being thrown or by being taken or lost), then
      the weapon loses its charge the following round. The
      weapon loses its held charge when you sleep or if you’re
      knocked unconscious or killed.
