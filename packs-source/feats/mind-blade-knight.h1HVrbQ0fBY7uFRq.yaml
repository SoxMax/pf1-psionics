  description:
    value: >-
      <p><em>You have gained additional flexibility with your summoned
      weapons.</em></p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Mind knight warrior path, expanded path
      class feature.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit: </strong>As long as you maintain focus, when you wield
      a weapon created by <em><a href="/wiki/Call_Weaponry" title="Call
      Weaponry">call weaponry</a></em>, you may choose to forgo some or all of
      the mind knight trance bonus to attack and damage rolls, and instead add
      an equal value of weapon special abilities to the weapon. These special
      abilities must be selected from the soulknife’s list of weapon special
      abilities, and your effective soulknife level for determining which
      abilities you can select is equal to half your psychic warrior level
      (rounded down). Once you have selected weapon special abilities to apply,
      you must spend 8 hours in meditation to change the selected special
      abilities, or to dismiss the special abilities and keep the normal trance
      bonus.

      </p>

      <p>If you have levels in a class that grants you a mind blade or similar
      weapon (such as a mind bolt or mind arrow), you may add those class levels
      to your psychic warrior levels to determine your manifester level for
      <em>call weaponry</em> and your mind knight trance bonus.
