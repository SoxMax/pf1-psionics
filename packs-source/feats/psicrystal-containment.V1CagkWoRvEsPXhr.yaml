    value: >-
      <p>Your psicrystal has advanced enough that it can hold a

      psionic focus that you store within it.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:
      </strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf1-psionics.feats.Item.pwkovU22CjU6Z5kN]{Psicrystal
      Affinity}, manifester level

      3rd.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit: </strong>You can psionically focus your psicrystal in

      the same manner in which you gain psionic focus. At

      any time when you need to expend your psionic focus,

      you can expend your psicrystal’s psionic focus instead,

      as long as the crystal is within 5 feet of you. At any time

      when you need to maintain psionic focus for an effect,

      you can use your psicrysta’s psionic focus instead, as long

      as the crystal is within 5 feet of you. Psionically focusing

      your psicrystal works just like focusing yourself. The

      psicrystal cannot focus itself—only the owner can spend

      the time to focus the crystal.

      </p>

      <p><br /></p>

      <p>Your psicrystal’s presence grants you focus.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Psicrystal Containment.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> So long as your psicrystal is within 5 feet
      of you, you are always treated as if you are maintaining psionic focus for
      abilities powered by maintaining psionic focus. You may still only expend
      your psionic focus if you are actually maintaining psionic focus. In
      addition, you can expend a use of mythic power as a swift action to regain
      both your own and your psicrystal’s psionic focus.
