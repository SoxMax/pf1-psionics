      <p><em>By binding a willing spirit to your psicrystal, you grant further power to yourself and enhanced survivability to it.</em></p>
      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf1-psionics.feats.Item.pwkovU22CjU6Z5kN]{Psicrystal Affinity}, @UUID[Compendium.pf1-psionics.feats.Item.pxNrNohrBxV4H5Hi]{Spirited Psicrystal}, manifester level 10th.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You make a pact with a spirit, binding it to your <a href="/wiki/Psicrystal" title="Psicrystal">psicrystal</a>. It may leave the psicrystal at any time as a free action, and you may free it at any time as a fullround action. If your psicrystal is destroyed, the spirit is immediately freed from it.
      </p>
      <p>Three times per day, while the spirit is bound within your psicrystal, you may draw on its essence for power – choosing one of the following abilities. Each of these abilities takes a standard action to activate, is a psilike effect, and functions at your manifester level. For each bonus you take, you owe one of the following to the spirit, to be paid within the next 24 hours: a part of your dreams (you must rest one additional hour to regain power points), some of your memories (you must spend one uninterrupted hour doing nothing but sitting and reminiscing), or a part of your soul (you gain one negative level). If you do not pay the spirit within the next 24 hours, you lose all benefits of this feat and cannot benefit from it again for one week.
      </p>
      <p>Gain temporary hit points equal to 1d10 + 1 per manifester level.
      </p>
      <p>Gain a bonus equal to 2 times your manifester level on the next attack roll you make. This attack must be before the end of your next turn, or the bonus is lost. Sustain you for 24 hours without food and water, as if using sustenance.
      </p>
      <p>Form a ghostly weapon. This weapon is a quasi-real masterwork melee weapon of a type you are proficient with. You may make attacks with this weapon as normal, dealing normal damage, except that this weapon only deals 1 point of damage to objects. This effect ends if the weapon leaves your possession.
      </p>
      <p>Conceal your form, becoming invisible for a number of minutes equal to your manifester level.
      </p>
