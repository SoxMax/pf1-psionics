    value: >-
      <p><em>You are shedding your physical form and your psicrystal, sharing an
      unbreakable bond of mind and soul is walking the same path as you. It has
      learned to shed its physical form as you have learned to shed your body
      and one day it will become uncarnate just as you.</em></p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong><a href="/wiki/Psicrystal_Affinity"
      title="Psicrystal Affinity">Psicrystal Affinity</a>, Shed Body class
      ability.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit: </strong>Your psicrystal gains the Shed Body class
      ability, usable as often as your ability is.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Special: </strong>If you have the Uncarnate class ability, your
      psicrystal also gains this ability and receives a deflection bonus to AC
      equal to his former natural armor, which it looses while incorporeal. If
      you are permanently incorporeal, so does your psicrystal become and can
      use Shed Body to instead become corporeal.
