      <p><em>Your force of will is heightened against the predations of ghosts
      and spirits.</em></p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Wis 13.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> While you maintain psionic focus, you gain a
      +1 bonus on saves against the abilities of any incorporeal creature.

      </p>

      <p>Additionally, if you expend your psionic focus as part of a save
      against one of these effects, you instead gain a bonus of +4 on that
      saving throw.
