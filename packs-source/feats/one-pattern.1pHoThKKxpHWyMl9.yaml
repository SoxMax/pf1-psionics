  description:
    value: |-
      <p>Your adventures have taught you that all creatures
      have a common thread to their patterns, and that they
      also all have that one loose thread to pull.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Prerequisites: </strong>Disrupt pattern class feature,
      Knowledge (arcane) 5 ranks, Knowledge (dungeoneering)
      5 ranks, Knowledge (nature) 5 ranks, Knowledge (planes)
      5 ranks, Knowledge (psionics), and Knowledge (religion)
      5 ranks.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Benefit: </strong>Your target no longer needs to match your
      active creature type to deal full damage with your
      disrupt pattern ability. If your target does match your
      active creature type, you inflict an extra 1 point of
      damage per dice of damage dealt with disrupt pattern.
      This extra damage is not multiplied on a critical hit.
      </p>
