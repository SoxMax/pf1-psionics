  description:
    value: >-
      <p><em>You have bound a powerful spirit to your psicrystal, gaining a
      servant that grows as you do.</em></p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf1-psionics.feats.Item.pwkovU22CjU6Z5kN]{Psicrystal
      Affinity}, manifester level 1st.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You replace your psicrystal with a
      three-headed psionic guardian, allying the splinter personality within it
      with a friendly spirit. Should your cerebric guardian be destroyed, you
      gain a new one in 24 hours. A new cerebric guardian must have the same
      personality as the original, and when created, may choose an additional
      two personalities. Once each day, when you would normally recover power
      points, you may choose which of the three personalities is active, gaining
      its benefits for the day.

      </p>

      <p>A cerebric guardian is treated the same as a psicrystal for the purpose
      of stats and advancement, with the following changes.

      </p><ul><li><em>Piece of Mind (Ex):</em> A cerebric guardian is invisible
      and cannot interact with or be interacted with by any creature other than
      its owner. It is always treated as adjacent to its owner, and cannot be
      targeted by or included in any effect not originating from its
      owner.</li></ul>

      <ul><li><em>This ability replaces flight.</em></li></ul>

      <ul><li><em>Manifest Mind (Ps):</em> At 7th level, once per day, you may
      manifest your cerebric guardian, just as if you were using astral
      construct, at a manifester level equal to 1/2 your HD. You spend power
      points to do so as normal, to a maximum of 1/2 your HD, but this is a
      supernatural effect and has a duration of 1 hour. While this astral
      construct exists, it counts as your cerebric guardian and can deliver
      touch powers for you, but loses all benefits of the piece of mind ability.
      If your cerebric guardian is destroyed while in this form, you cannot use
      manifest mind again for 24 hours, you lose power points equal to your
      character level and are stunned for one round. This astral construct
      cannot venture more than 100 feet from you – if it does so, the astral
      construct immediately disperses, returning your cerebric guardian to its
      original form.</li></ul>

      <ul><li><em>This ability modifies deliver touch powers.</em></li></ul>

      <ul><li><em>Form of Fear (Su):</em> At 13th level, you may use manifest
      mind one additional time each day. When you use manifest mind, any enemy
      within 20 feet of the astral construct must succeed at a Will save (DC 13
      + the primary manifesting ability score modifier of your highest level
      manifesting class) or be shaken for 5 minutes or until the cerebric
      guardian is no longer in astral construct form, whichever happens
      first.</li></ul>

      <ul><li><em>This ability replaces sight link.</em></li></ul>

      <ul><li><em>Channel Power (Sp):</em> This ability functions as normal,
      except that it only functions if the cerebric guardian is within 100 feet
      of you.</li></ul>
