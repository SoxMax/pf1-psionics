  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Your astral constructs have more abilities.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit: </strong>When you create an astral construct, you can

      give it one additional special ability from any menu that

      the construct currently has an ability from.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Special: </strong>This effect stacks with the Summoner’s Call

      ability of the shaper.

      </p>

      <p>Your astral constructs are creatures of legendary might and toughness.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Boost Construct.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Any astral construct you create is considered
      mythic for the purpose of interacting with other mythic creatures. It
      doesn’t gain any mythic abilities or powers, but is affected by mythic
      powers, spells, and abilities as if it were a 1st-tier mythic creature.
      Additionally, if the astral construct has damage reduction, its damage
      reduction becomes DR/epic.
