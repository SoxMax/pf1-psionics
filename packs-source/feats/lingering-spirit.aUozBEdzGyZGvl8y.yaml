  description:
    value: >-
      <p><em>Your spirit is unusually tenacious, and death does not become
      you.</em></p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Con 13, character level 5th.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You do not die until reduced to twice your
      Constitution score, expressed as a negative number (for example, a
      character with a 13 Constitution does not die until they are reduced to
      -26 hit points or lower).

      </p>

      <p><strong>Normal:</strong> A character without this feat dies when
      reduced to their Constitution score, expressed as a negative number.
