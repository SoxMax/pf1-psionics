  description:
    value: >-
      <p><em>You have the spark of psionic power, allowing you to broaden your
      elemental abilities.</em></p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong><a href="/wiki/Kineticist"
      title="Kineticist">Kineticist</a> level 1st.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You learn a simple blast from any element
      (including your primary element, if there is another blast for you to
      choose). Unless you later gain access to this blast through another
      method, you increase its burn cost by 1 whenever you use it. In addition,
      you gain the psionic subtype, allowing you to take psionic feats,
      metapsionic feats, and psionic item creation feats. If you do not have
      your primary element's basic utility talent (for example, if you have
      traded it away with an archetype), you also gain that wild talent.
