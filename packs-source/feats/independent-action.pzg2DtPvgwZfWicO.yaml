  description:
    value: >-
      <p><em>Your afterimage and parallel actions can function somewhat
      independently from your own thoughts, pursuing your goals even when your
      attention is elsewhere or your will is subverted.</em></p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Parallel action class feature,
      afterimage class feature.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> If your ability to think is impaired or your
      actions are removed entirely (such as by being stunned or affected by a
      <em>dominate person </em>spell), you can still move your afterimage and
      take parallel actions according to your best interests, even if an effect
      would normally prevent you from doing so or control your choices. This
      does not give your afterimages abilities they otherwise didn’t have,
      though—they still use your senses (they do not have their own), do not
      have minds of their own, and so on. This feat merely allows you to
      continue to use parallel actions when you otherwise couldn’t.

      </p>

      <p>In addition, when you are affected by an ongoing mind-affecting effect
      that allows a saving throw such as <em>charm person </em>or <em>crushing
      despair</em>), you can use your parallel action to make another save
      against it.

      </p>
