    value: |-
      <p>Your experience with joining minds has progressed to
      the point that you are now able to maintain a permanent
      telepathic connection with others.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Prerequisites: </strong>Manifester level 3rd, ability to
      manifest <em><a href="/wiki/Mindlink" title="Mindlink">mindlink</a></em>.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Benefit: </strong>As long as you maintain psionic focus, you
      may maintain a telepathic connection between yourself
      and other willing creatures. Creatures so connected may
      communicate with you and each other telepathically,
      even if they do not share a common language.
      </p>
      <p>As a standard action, you may add any number of
      creatures in line of sight to this link; however the link
      may never contain more creatures than your key ability
      modifier (minimum 1). You are always a member of the
      link and do not count against this limit. You may remove
      any number of creatures from the link as a free action,
      and any creature within the link may remove itself as
      a free action. Any creature in the link which moves
      beyond medium range (100 ft. + 10 ft./manifester level)
      from you or falls unconscious or dies is automatically
      removed from the link.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Special: </strong>You may take this feat multiple times. Each
      additional time, the maximum number of creatures in
      the link is increased by 2.
      </p>
