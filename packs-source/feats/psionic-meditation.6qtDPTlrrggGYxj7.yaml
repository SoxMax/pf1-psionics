      <p><em>Gaining psionic focus comes second nature to you.</em></p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong><a href="/wiki/Psionic_Meditation"
      title="Psionic Meditation">Psionic Meditation</a>.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You no longer provoke attacks of opportunity
      when meditating to gain psionic focus. Should you have multiple psionic
      foci, such as from <a href="/wiki/Deep_Focus" title="Deep Focus">Deep
      Focus</a>, you regain any psionic focus you are not currently maintaining
      anytime you meditate to gain psionic focus. In addition, you can expend a
      use of mythic power to regain your psionic focus as a free action.
