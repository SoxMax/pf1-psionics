      <p>You can charge in a crooked line.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Prerequisite: </strong>Dex 13, @UUID[Compendium.pf1-psionics.feats.Item.Dr98xNmCPlKoAJkI]{Speed of Thought}.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Benefit: </strong>To use this feat, you must expend your psionic
      focus. When you charge, you can make one turn of up to
      90 degrees during your movement. All other restrictions
      on charges still apply; for instance, you cannot pass
      through a square that blocks or slows movement, or that
      contains a creature. You must have line of sight to the
      opponent at the start of your turn.
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p>You have learned to charge a foe regardless of the path to reach him.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Psionic Charge.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When using Psionic Charge, you can make a number of additional 90 degree turns equal to half your tier (minimum 1). For example, at 4th tier, you could make three 90 degree turns during a charge
