      <p><em>You can fuse elements together.</em></p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> To use this feat, you must expend your
      psionic focus. You can mix a second element into any power that deals
      cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage. Choose one other energy type
      from that list; half of the power's damage is that element rather than its
      normal type. If the power has additional effects based on the type of
      damage it deals, then both the effect of the original element and the
      effect of the second element are applied to the targets. Using this feat
      increases the power point cost of the power by 2. The power's total cost
      cannot exceed your manifester level.
