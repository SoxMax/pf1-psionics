    value: >-
      <p><em>You have learned how to erect walls in your mind, and potentially
      in those of your allies.</em></p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Autohypnosis 5 ranks.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You can perform the suppress psyche occult
      skill unlock even if you can't cast psychic spells. If you can cast
      psychic spells or have the
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1.feats.Item.3owNW4QoIZK6Pwm5]{Psychic Sensitivity}
      feat, you can use suppress psyche one additional time per day.

      </p>

      <p>In addition, you can use suppress psyche on another willing creature as
      long as your minds are somehow linked together (such as via <em><a
      href="/wiki/Mindlink" title="Mindlink">mindlink</a></em>, <em><a>geth's
      mind control</a></em>, or the collective class feature). In this case the
      DC for success is 20 + the subject's Will save modifier against
      mind-affecting enchantment (compulsion) effects. On any round where the
      subject's suppressed state could make them do something suicidal or
      against their nature (e.g. walking into lava they can't perceive, or
      attacking an ally they have forgotten), they are entitled to a Will save
      (DC = 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Charisma modifier). A
      successful save ends the suppression immediately.
