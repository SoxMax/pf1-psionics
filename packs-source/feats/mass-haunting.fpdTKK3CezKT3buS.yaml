      <p><em>Your psicrystal and phantom can remain merged for much longer than
      usual.</em></p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Collective class feature, phantom class
      feature.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Your phantom is always considered to be a
      member of your collective, but does not contribute towards the maximum
      number of creatures you may have in your collective. In addition, you may
      harbor your phantom within the consciousness of any member of your
      collective, granting them the benefits of your shared consciousness class
      feature. As a full-round action, you can transfer your phantom from one
      mind within your collective to another. If a creature harboring your
      phantom dies, your phantom immediately returns to your mind. Your phantom
      treats members of your collective as you for the purposes of your etheric
      tether ability.

      </p>

      <p>In addition, you add 1/2 your <a href="/wiki/Spiritualist"
      title="Spiritualist">spiritualist</a> level to your levels in classes that
      grant the collective class feature for determining the range of your
      collective, and you add 1/2 your levels in such classes to your
      spiritualist level for determining the effect of your shared consciousness
      ability.

      </p>
