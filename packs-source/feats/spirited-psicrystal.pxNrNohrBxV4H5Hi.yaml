  description:
    value: >-
      <p><em>Even after you die and return from death, your psicrystal remains
      bonded to you.</em></p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf1-psionics.feats.Item.pwkovU22CjU6Z5kN]{Psicrystal
      Affinity}, manifester level 5th.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Whenever you die and are returned to life,
      your psicrystal automatically reforms immediately. When it reforms, it
      must have the same personality as the original.

      </p>

      <p>In addition, having this extra bond strengthens you against further
      peril. While your psicrystal is active, you gain a +2 bonus on saves
      against death effects and on checks made to stabilize while you are dying.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Normal:</strong> When you die, your psicrystal is destroyed.
      When your psicrystal is destroyed, it reforms after 24 hours.
