      <p>You can upgrade your psicrystal.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites: </strong><a href="/wiki/Psicrystal_Affinity"
      title="Psicrystal Affinity">Psicrystal Affinity</a>.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit: </strong>You can implant another personality

      fragment in your psicrystal. You gain the benefits of both

      psicrystal personalities. Your psicrystal’s personality

      adjusts and becomes a blend between all implanted

      personality fragments. From now on, when determining

      the abilities of your psicrystal, treat your level as one

      higher than your normal level.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Special: </strong>You can gain this feat multiple times. Each

      time, you implant a new personality fragment in your

      psicrystal, from which you derive the noted benefits,

      and you treat your level as one higher for the purpose of

      determining your psicrystal’s abilities.

      </p>

      <p><br /></p>

      <p>The personality fragments from your psicrystal greatly improve your
      abilities.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Improved Psicrystal.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> The bonus gained from all of your psicrystal
      personalities doubles. 

      </p>
