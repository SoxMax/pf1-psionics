    value: |-
      <p><em>Your ability to sense aggression in your enemies has developed into a sixth sense.</em></p>
      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf1-psionics.feats.Item.MijZXGGv7ctzweIc]{Detect Hostility}.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Whenever you come within 30 feet of a creature feeling hostility, you are entitled to a Knowledge (martial) check to notice it as if you were actively searching for it. You can detect hostility aimed at yourself from any range as long as the target is observing you in some way, even through divination magic, but you cannot determine where it is coming from unless you can see the source (which may require a Perception check) or the source is within 30 feet.
