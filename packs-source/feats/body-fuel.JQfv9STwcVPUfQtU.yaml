    value: >-
      <p>You can expand your power point total at the expense

      of your health.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit: </strong>You can recover 2 power points by taking

      1 point of ability burn damage to each of your three

      physical ability scores: Strength, Dexterity, and

      Constitution.

      </p>

      <p>You can recover additional power points for a

      proportional cost to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution.

      These recovered points are added to your power point

      reserve as if you had gained them by resting overnight.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Special: </strong>Only living creatures can use this feat. You

      can take advantage of this feat only while in your own

      body.

      </p>

      <p>You are able to selectively decide which ability to sacrifice for more
      power points.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Body Fuel.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When using the Body Fuel feat, you need only
      choose a single physical ability score (Strength, Dexterity, or
      Constitution) to suffer ability burn, instead of all three. 

      </p>
