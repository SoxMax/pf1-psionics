      <p><em>You are able to make your thrown weapons return to your
      hand.</em></p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong><a rel="nofollow" class="external text"
      href="https://www.aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Point-Blank%20Shot">Point-Blank
      Shot</a>, base attack bonus +1.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> As long as you maintain psionic focus,
      weapons you throw return to the square from which they were thrown just
      before your next turn. Catching any returning weapons is a free action. If
      you can’t catch the weapon, it drops to the ground.

      </p>

      <p>You may expend your psionic focus as part of a thrown attack to make
      the weapon you throw return to your hand immediately after any thrown
      attack resolves. This effect lasts until the end of your turn, allowing
      you to attack multiple times with the same thrown weapon if multiple
      attacks are otherwise available.

      </p>

      <p>If the weapon (or shield) being thrown has the ranged, returning, or
      teleporting special ability, your attacks are treated as if you had
      expended psionic focus to power this feat.

      </p>
