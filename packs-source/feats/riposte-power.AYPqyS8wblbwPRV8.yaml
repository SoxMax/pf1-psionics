      <p><em>You can manifest a power in response to an attack.</em></p>

      <p><strong>Benefit: </strong>To use this feat, you must expend your
      psionic focus. You can manifest a riposte power as an immediate action
      against a target that has just attacked you or forced you to make a save
      against an ability, power, or spell. Using this feat increases the power
      point cost of the power by 4. The power’s total cost cannot exceed your
      manifester level.
