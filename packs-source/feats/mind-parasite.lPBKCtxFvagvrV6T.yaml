      <p><em>You gain sustenance and abilities from the members of your
      collective.</em></p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Collective class feature.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit: </strong>You can draw on the members of your
      collective to sustain yourself and grant you additional abilities. As long
      as you have at least one other member

      in your collective, you do not need to eat or drink, but all members of
      your collective are ravenous and require more food to sate their own
      hunger. In addition, up to 3

      times per day, as a swift action, you can deal 1 point of damage to each
      of them and heal the same amount of damage to yourself.
