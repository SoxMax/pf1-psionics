      <p>Your collective has a longer range than normal.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites: </strong>Manifester level 3rd, collective class

      feature.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit: </strong>The range of your collective is now long
      range

      (400 ft. + 40 ft. per class level). Additionally the range

      of your collective becomes unlimited at 12th level and

      planar at 16th level. At 19th level, if a member of your

      collective would be removed from the collective due to

      dying or their Wisdom being reduced to 0, they remain

      in the collective for 24 hours, although they are still

      dead or have a 0 Wisdom and remain unconscious, as

      appropriate. However, you do not suffer any penalties

      while they remain in your collective.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Normal: </strong>The range of your collective is medium range

      (100 ft. + 10 ft. per class level), and the level at which

      your collective increase to unlimited and planar ranges

      are level 15 and level 19 respectively.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Special: </strong>If you have the <a
      href="/wiki/Expansive_Collective" title="Expansive Collective">Expansive
      Collective</a> feat,

      use your total Hit Dice instead of your class level.

      </p>
