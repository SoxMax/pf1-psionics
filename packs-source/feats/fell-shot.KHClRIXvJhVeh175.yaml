      <p><em>Your ranged attacks are exceptionally accurate.</em></p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong><a href="/wiki/Fell_Shot" title="Fell
      Shot">Fell Shot</a>.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When you make an attack using Fell Shot, add
      half your tier (minimum 1) to the attack roll. In addition, you can expend
      a use of mythic power when using Fell Shot to treat all ranged attacks
      made during your turn as ranged touch attacks.
