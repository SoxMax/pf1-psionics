      <p><em>You can invoke your surge to disrupt powers and spells.</em></p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf1.feats.Item.Uuiu3p982omhMEPj]{Improved
      Initiative}, wild surge class feature, manifester level 6th.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit: </strong>You may invoke your wild surge as an
      immediate action in response to a power being manifested, or a spell being
      cast, within 100 feet of you. If you do, the source of the power or spell
      must succeed at a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your manifester level + your
      Charisma modifier) or that power or spell has its caster or manifester
      level (and, as a result, all effects dependent on caster or manifester
      level, such as damage and range) reduced by an amount equal to your wild
      surge's intensity. If this would reduce the power or spell's level below
      the minimum needed to cast it, that power or spell is still cast, though a
      spell or power with its caster level reduced to 0 or lower is negated and
      has no effect. Using this feat increases your chance of psychic enervation
      by 20%. You must declare that you are using this feat after the power is
      manifested or the spell is cast, but before its results are determined.
