  description:
    value: |-
      <p>You can psionically carry your disarm maneuver’s
      force through your foe.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Prerequisite: </strong>Improved Disarm.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Benefit: </strong>While maintaining psionic focus, when you
      successfully perform a disarm combat maneuver, you
      also deal damage equal to half your level to the creature
      disarmed.
      </p>
      <p>If you expend your psionic focus when you make a
      successful disarm combat maneuver, you can also send
      the disarmed object into any space of your choosing
      within 25 ft. +5 ft./2 levels. If a creature is in the selected
      space and has a hand free, it can grab the disarmed
      object as an immediate action.
