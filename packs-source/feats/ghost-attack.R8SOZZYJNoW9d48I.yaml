    value: >-
      <p>Your deadly strikes against incorporeal foes more

      frequently find their mark.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite: </strong>Base attack bonus +3.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit: </strong>You must be psionically focused to use this

      feat. When you make a successful melee attack or a

      ranged attack against an incorporeal creature, your

      attack deals 75% damage instead of the standard 50%

      damage.

      </p>

      <p>If you expend your psionic focus as part of the attack,

      your attack deals full damage.  You must decide whether

      or not to use this option prior to making an attack. If

      your attack misses, you still expend your psionic focus.

      Your weapon or natural weapon actually appears to

      become briefly incorporeal as the attack is made.

      </p>

      <p><br /></p>

      <p>Your attacks against the incorporeal are more especially effective.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Ghost Attack.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Your attacks against incorporeal creatures
      always deal full damage. In addition, you can expend a use of mythic power
      as a swift action when you make a successful attack against an incorporeal
      creature to deal an additional amount of damage equal to your tier. 

      </p>
