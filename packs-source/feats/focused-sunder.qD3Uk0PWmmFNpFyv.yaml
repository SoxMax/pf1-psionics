      <p>You can sense the stress points on others’ weapons.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Prerequisite: </strong>Str 13, Power Attack, Improved Sunder.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Benefit: </strong>To use this feat, you must expend your
      psionic focus. When you strike at an opponent’s weapon,
      you ignore half of the weapon’s total hardness (round
      down). Total hardness includes any magical or psionic
      enhancements possessed by the weapon that increase
      its hardness.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Special: </strong>You can also sense the stress points in any
      hard construction, such as wooden doors or stone walls,
      and can ignore half of the object’s total hardness (round
      down) when attacking that object. You must still expend
      your psionic focus when using this special option.
      </p>
