      <p>You can share your gravity-defying abilities.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Prerequisites: </strong>Elocater level 5th, @UUID[Compendium.pf1-psionics.feats.Item.AlIkoXpL8ttICja9]{Gravitic Stability}</p>
      <p><strong>Benefit: </strong>When you gain psionic focus, you may
      choose to share the benefit of your personal gravity,
      scorn earth, and terminal velocity abilities with all
      adjacent allies. When you move, all affected allies move
      with you on your turn. Allies may move around you
      freely on their own turns (for example, an ally in front
      of you could move to stand behind you), but if any ally
      moves more than 5 ft. away from you, the effect ends
      immediately for that ally. If you are attacked, you must
      make a concentration check as if concentrating on a
      2nd-level power to maintain this effect. If subjected
      to harsh environmental effects which would disrupt
      concentration (such as strong winds), you must make a
      concentration check once per hour of overland travel in
      such conditions.
      </p>
      <p>In addition, your speed is no longer reduced to 10
      ft. when wearing medium or heavy armor or carrying
      a medium load while using personal gravity or scorn
      earth, although your base land speed is still reduced
      as normal for such, unless you have an ability or trait
      such as a fighter’s armor training or a dwarf’s slow and
      steady. You may use personal gravity and scorn earth
      while heavily encumbered, but your movement speed
      is reduced to 10 ft. plus any applicable speed bonuses.
