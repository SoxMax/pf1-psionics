      <p><em>You conduct your energies with a powerful rhythm.</em></p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Bardic performance or raging song class
      feature, kineticist level 1st.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Your kineticist levels and your levels in the
      class that granted you the bardic performance or raging song class feature
      stack for determining the number of performance rounds you have per day
      and the strength of your music effects (but not which effects you have
      access to). In addition, you can activate a bardic performance or raging
      song ability that normally requires a standard action to start as part of
      using a kinetic blast. If you do, the ability takes effect before your
      attack roll.
