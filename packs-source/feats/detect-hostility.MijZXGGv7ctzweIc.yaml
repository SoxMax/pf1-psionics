      <p><em>You know how to search for the "killing intent" that creatures
      subconsciously aim at their enemies.</em></p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf1.feats.Item.pmAO1Sni8xx71pLF]{Blind-Fight}
      feat or the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text"
      href="https://www.aonprd.com/UMR.aspx?ItemName=Scent">Scent</a> ability,
      Knowledge (martial) 5 ranks.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You can perform the anticipate ambush occult
      skill unlock even if you can't cast psychic spells. If you can cast
      psychic spells or have the Psychic Sensitivity feat, you can use
      anticipate ambush one additional time per day.

      </p>

      <p>At any time as a standard action, you can attempt a Knowledge (martial)
      check to detect whether any creatures within 30 feet carry a desire to
      fight, kill or otherwise defeat someone they can see. Using this ability
      does not require you to be aware of the creatures in question, but you
      cannot sense hostility from a creature immune to mind-affecting effects
      unless they are actively focusing it onto another creature in some way
      (such as via the Intimidate skill, the paladin's smite evil, the
      cavalier's challenge or the harbinger's dark claim). If you succeed then
      you learn the locations of each source of hostility, as well as the type
      of hostility involved (friendly, adversarial or malicious). If you succeed
      by 5 or more then you can determine who these hostile feelings are
      directed at, as long as both the target and the aggressor are within your
      line of sight. You always know if hostility is directed at you, even if
      you cannot see the target.

      </p><table><tr><th>Type of Hostility

      </th><th>DC

      </th></tr><tr><td>Friendly (wants to spar with the target)

      </td><td>15 + the aggressor's base attack bonus + the aggressor's Wisdom
      modifier

      </td></tr><tr><td>Adversarial (wants to stop the target)

      </td><td>10 + the aggressor's base attack bonus + the aggressor's Wisdom
      modifier

      </td></tr><tr><td>Malicious (wants to make the target suffer)

      </td><td>5 + the aggressor's base attack bonus + the aggressor's Wisdom
      modifier

      </td></tr></table>

      <table><tr><th>DC Modifiers

      </th><th>DC

      </th></tr><tr><td>Aggressor is attacking the target

      </td><td>–10

      </td></tr><tr><td>You are the target of the aggressor's feelings

      </td><td>–5

      </td></tr><tr><td>Aggressor is shaken, frightened or panicked

      </td><td>+5

      </td></tr><tr><td>Aggressor is using the Intimidate skill on target

      </td><td>–5

      </td></tr><tr><td>Aggressor has placed a smite, challenge or Claim on
      target.

      </td><td>–5

      </td></tr><tr><td>Aggressor is under the effects of a nondetection spell
      or similar effect

      </td><td>+10

      </td></tr></table>

      <p>If an aggressor is concerned of its hostility being noticed and wants
      to hide it, then the Knowledge (martial) DC is instead equal to 10 + their
      Bluff modifier (if higher than the normal DC). Creatures using the Stealth
      skill are assumed to be hiding their hostility unless stated otherwise.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> Outsiders with the evil subtype are
      considered to radiate malicious hostility towards all creatures they can
      see, regardless of the personality and goals of the outsider in question.
      At your GM's option, other kinds of creatures might radiate hostility of
      different kinds (such as celestials radiating friendly hostility, or
      ghosts radiating adversarial hostility).

      </p>

      <p>A warder with the sworn protector archetype (or a character with a
      similar ability) may treat hostility aimed at their ward as hostility
      aimed at themselves for determining their ability to sense it.
