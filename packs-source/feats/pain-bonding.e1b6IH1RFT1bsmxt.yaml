      <p>You can form a collective with willing creatures; those
      creatures can withstand your enervation for you.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Prerequisites: </strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf1-psionics.feats.Item.phuWrJ3XbPv2helO]{Vent Agony}, Autohypnosis 9 ranks.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Benefit: </strong>You may form a collective with which to
      share the pain of your psionic backlash. As a standard
      action, you may join any number of willing targets to
      your collective (up to your limit, see below). You must
      have line of sight to each target, each target must have a
      Wisdom score of at least 1, and all targets must be within
      Medium range (100 feet plus 10 feet per manifester
      level). Your collective may contain up to a number of
      creatures equal to your Charisma modifier. You are
      always considered a member of your own collective, and
      do not count against this limit.
      </p>
      <p>You can choose to remove a member as a free action
      on your turn, and any member can voluntarily leave the
      collective as a free action on their turn. Any member
      whose Wisdom drops to zero or who moves out of
      range of the collective is automatically removed. If a
      member enters a <em>null psionics field</em>, the connection to
      the collective is suppressed until that member leaves the
      field. A member who leaves the collective for any reason
      immediately loses any and all benefits they may have
      gained from being a member. You are aware of the status
      of this collective and can, roughly, sense the presence of
      each member, although beyond telling if such a creature
      is still a member, this has no mechanical benefit.
      </p>
      <p>Whenever you would suffer psychic enervation, a
      willing member of your collective may choose to suffer
      its effects instead of you. When you use the Overchannel
      feat, you may divide the damage amongst willing
      members of your collective in increments as small as 1
      die (that is, if your Overchannel feat would deal you 3d8
      points of damage and there are 2 willing members of
      your collective, you and those members each suffer 1d8
      points of damage). This feat counts as having a collective
      as a class feature for the purpose of prerequisites.
