      <p><em>You have mastered the art of scribing psionic tattoos.</em></p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong><a href="/wiki/Scribe_Tattoo"
      title="Scribe Tattoo">Scribe Tattoo</a>, manifester level 3rd.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> At the beginning of each day when you regain
      your uses of mythic power, you can expend one use of mythic power to
      accomplish eight hours of work on one psionic tattoo you are scribing. You
      can only do this once per day per tattoo you are scribing, though you may
      also add an actual eighthour work day toward the scribing of such a
      tattoo.

      </p>

      <p>Unlike normal tattoo scribing, work accomplished by expending a use of
      mythic power does not require any special work space or quiet (though the
      cost of making magic items created this way is normal).

      </p>

      <p>Additionally, there is no limit to the level of power you can imbue
      into a tattoo.
