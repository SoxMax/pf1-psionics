    value: |-
      <p>You can draw on your psionic power to boost the
      power of a trip attack.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Prerequisites: </strong>Int 13, Combat Expertise, Improved
      Trip.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Benefit: </strong>While maintaining psionic focus, when you
      successfully perform a trip combat maneuver, you also
      deal damage equal to half your level to the creature
      tripped.
      </p>
      <p>If you expend your psionic focus when you perform
      a successful trip combat maneuver, you can also throw
      your target up to 5 feet, +5 feet for every four levels you
      possess, although the creature thrown may not be more
      than one size category larger than you.
