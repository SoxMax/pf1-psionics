    value: >-
      <p><em>You can create an imprint of the abilities of a member of your
      collective within your mind.</em></p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Collective class feature, tribute class
      feature.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Once per day, as a full-round action, you can
      select a feat possessed or power known by another member of your
      collective. You must meet the prerequisites for a feat chosen this way.
      You gain that feat or learn that power until you use this feat again, in
      which case you switch the feat or power previously gained by mind trace
      for the new one. Unlike feats granted through the tribute ability, or
      powers usable through contact in the collective, you retain feats or
      powers known from mind trace even if all other creatures that possess them
      leave your collective.
