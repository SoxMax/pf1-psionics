    value: |-
      <p>Through practiced effort, you have mastered the art of
      resonating powers through your psicrystal.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Prerequisites: </strong>Psicrystal imprinter 5th, any
      metapsionic feat.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Benefit: </strong>When you use the psicrystal resonance class
      feature, choose any single metapsionic feat that you
      posses that increases the power point cost of a power
      by your psicrystal imprinter level minus 3 or less. Feats
      which reduce manifesting time, such as Hustle PowerPE
      or Quicken Power, may not be chosen. Instead of gaining
      one of the normal benefits of psicrystal resonance,
      you may choose to instead apply the effects of that
      metapsionic feat to the power being manifested.
      </p>
      <p>The power is treated as if manifested with the
      selected metapsionic feat, but the power point cost is not
      increased nor are you required to expend your psionic
      focus. Instead, the manifestation time is increased. If
      the power has a manifestation time of less than one
      round, increase the manifesting time to one full round;
      otherwise, increase the manifesting time by one full
      round. If the metapsionic feat would normally increase
      the power point cost of the power by more than 2 power
      points, add one round to the manifesting time for every
      2 power points that the metapsionic feat would have
      increased the power cost beyond the first 2.
