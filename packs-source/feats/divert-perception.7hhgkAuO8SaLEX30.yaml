    value: >-
      <p><em>Your movement itself obscures your presence, allowing you to hide
      more easily.</em></p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Stealth 5 ranks.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You can move up to your speed and use Stealth
      at no penalty. You can use Stealth while running or charging with a –5
      penalty.

      </p>

      <p>In addition, whenever you take a move action to move while psionically
      focused, you can expend your psionic focus in order to make a Stealth
      check to hide at the end of the movement, even if you do not have
      concealment or are observed. You remain hidden until the end of your next
      turn or until you break Stealth, whichever comes first.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Normal: </strong>You can move up to half your normal speed and
      use Stealth at no penalty. When moving at a speed greater than half but
      less than your normal speed, you take a –5 penalty. It’s impossible to use
      Stealth while attacking, running, or charging.
