      <p>You reduce the damage of an attack on an ally.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite: </strong>Wisdom 15, collective class feature,

      manifester level 6th.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit: </strong>As long as you are maintaining psionic focus,

      as an immediate action, you can minimize the damage

      of a single attack with a ranged, melee, or natural

      weapon or unarmed strike (treat all dice rolled as 1s) on

      any member of the collective. This ability must be used

      in response to an attack on a member of the collective.

      </p>

      <p>In addition, if you expend your psionic focus, you

      can reduce any additional damage on the attack (such

      as bonus damage from a high Strength or sneak attack

      damage) by your key ability modifier.

      </p>

      <p><br /></p>

      <p>You are able to block damage to multiple targets at once.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Cushion the Blow.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You can share the effect of Cushion the Blow,
      Greater Cushion the Blow, and Improved Cushion the Blow to a number of
      members of your collective equal to your mythic tier. In addition, if you
      expend one use of mythic power, you can use Cushion the Blow as a free
      action even if it is not your turn.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Normal:</strong> Using Cushion the Blow is an immediate action
      and only applies to a single member of your collective
