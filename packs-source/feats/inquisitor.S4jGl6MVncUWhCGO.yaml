    value: >-
      <p>You know when others lie.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite: </strong>Wis 13.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit: </strong>While you maintain psionic focus, you gain

      a +2 enhancement bonus on Sense Motive checks to

      oppose a Bluff check. If you have at least 10 ranks in

      Sense Motive, this bonus increases to +4.

      </p>

      <p>Additionally, you may expend your psionic focus to

      gain a +10 bonus on a Sense Motive check to oppose a

      Bluff check. You must decide whether or not to use this

      option prior to making a Sense Motive check. If your

      check fails, or if the opponent isn’t lying, you still expend

      your psionic focus. If you have at least 10 ranks in Sense

      Motive, this bonus increases to +20 when you expend

      your psionic focus.

      </p>

      <p><br /></p>

      <p>You are extraordinarily good at detecting lies.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Inquisitor.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> The bonus on Sense Motive checks to oppose
      Bluff checks increases by 2. In addition, you can expend one use of mythic
      power to treat a Sense Motive check to oppose a Bluff check as if you had
      rolled a natural 20. You must decide to use this ability before making the
      roll.
