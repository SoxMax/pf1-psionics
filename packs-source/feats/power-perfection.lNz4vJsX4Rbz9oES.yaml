    value: |-
      <p>You are unequaled at the manifesting of one particular
      power.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Prerequisites: </strong>Spellcraft 15 ranks, at least three
      metapsionic feats.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Benefit: </strong>Pick one power which you have the ability to
      manifest. Whenever you manifest that power you may
      apply any one metapsionic feat you have to that power
      without expending psionic focus or affecting its level or
      manifesting time, as long as the total power point cost
      of the power, including the metapsionic feat cost and
      any augmentation, does not exceed 17 power points. In
      addition, if you have other feats which allow you to apply
      a set numerical bonus to any aspect of this power (such
      as Power Penetration, Psionic Endowment, Weapon
      Focus [ray], and so on), double the bonus granted by that
      feat when applied to this power.
