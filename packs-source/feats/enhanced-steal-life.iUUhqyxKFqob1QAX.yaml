  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You make it more difficult for others to resist you

      stealing their life.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites: </strong>Steal life class feature.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit: </strong>When you use your steal life class feature,

      you can channel power points into it to increase the DC

      of the save. For every three power points you spend,

      the save DC is increased by 1. You may not spend more

      power points in this fashion than your manifester level.

      </p>

      <p><br /></p>

      <p>You are skilled at extracting the life force out of other creatures.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Enhanced Steal Life.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> The number of hit points gained when using
      steal life is increased by 50% (round down.) When using the steal life
      class feature, you can expend one use of mythic power. If the target makes
      a successful save against the attempt, you instead steal hit points as if
      you had used the steal health class feature
