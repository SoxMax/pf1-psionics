    value: >-
      <p><em>You can shift powers out of the timestream before they take effect,
      delaying their effect until needed.</em></p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Manifester level 10th.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit: </strong>To use this feat, you must expend your
      psionic focus. You manifest a personal psionic power and slip it out of
      the timestream, which means it stops existing just before activating.
      Activating a timeslipped power takes a swift action, at which point the
      power acts as if you had just manifest it. Using this feat increases the
      power point cost of the power by 8. You can only have one timeslipped
      power per five manifester levels. The power’s total cost cannot exceed
      your manifester level.
