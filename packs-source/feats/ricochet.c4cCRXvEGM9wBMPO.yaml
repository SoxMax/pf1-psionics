      <p><em>You are able to redirect your thrown attacks.</em></p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf1.feats.Item.8rsFtye3PwM6CKli]{Point-Blank
      Shot}, base attack bonus +6.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> If a thrown attack of yours would strike a
      flat and sturdy surface, such as a wall, you may expend your psionic focus
      to psychoportatively redirect its momentum up to 90 degrees, allowing it
      to continue as if it were thrown in that new direction. Each time you
      redirect your attack in this manner, your attack roll suffers a -2 penalty
      on the attack and damage roll.

      </p>

      <p>You may even recover from missed attacks this way: if a failed attack
      would also miss a creature’s touch AC, it continues past the creature,
      potentially rebounding off of another wall for another attempt to hit. All
      distance traveled, regardless of direction, counts toward the weapon’s
      range.

      </p>

      <p>You may attempt a number of redirections per attack equal to 1 plus
      your Wisdom modifier.

      </p>
