      <p>You are able to force others into your collective.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite: </strong>Collective class feature.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit: </strong>You may attempt to force a living creature

      into your collective as a standard action. The target may

      attempt a Will save (DC 10 + half manifester level level

      + Wisdom modifier) to resist. If the target fails the save,

      it may attempt another Will save at the same DC every

      24 hours thereafter, but is otherwise unable to leave the

      collective unless you allow it.

      </p>

      <p>If you expend your psionic focus while using this feat,

      the action required to attempt to force a living creature

      into your collective is instead a move action.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Normal: </strong>Only willing creatures may be added to a

      collective. Creatures may leave the collective as a free

      action.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Special: </strong>Creatures forced into your collective using

      Unwilling Participant are considered willing members

      for any collective-related effects unless they succeed on

      another Will save at the same DC to resist being forced

      into the collective. A successful save means the creature

      resisted the specific effect but is still a member of the

      collective.

      </p>

      <p>Creatures find it difficult to resist joining your collective.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Unwilling Participant, 2nd mythic tier.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You add half your tier to the save DC when
      forcing an unwilling creature into your collective. Additionally, you can
      expend one use of mythic power when a creature succeeds on its saving
      throw against being added to your collective to force that creature to
      roll a second time and take the lower result. 

      </p>
