      <p><em>You have learned enhanced techniques to make sure you are always
      armed and dangerous.</em></p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Wis 13, <a
      href="/wiki/Psionic_Meditation" title="Psionic Meditation">Psionic
      Meditation</a>, <a href="/wiki/Psionic_Shot" title="Psionic Shot">Psionic
      Shot</a> OR <a href="/wiki/Psionic_Weapon" title="Psionic Weapon">Psionic
      Weapon</a>, mind knight path class feature, manifester level 10th, base
      attack bonus +6

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit: </strong>As long as you have both mind knight path
      powers, you can manifest both mind knight path powers at the same time as
      a single standard action. Any time you manifest <a
      href="/wiki/Call_Weaponry" title="Call Weaponry">call weaponry</a>, you
      may select one other 1st level power you know; you may manifest that power
      using martial power as if it were a path power, as long as the attack is
      made using the weapon summoned. In addition, when using the mind knight
      maneuver, you gain a +1 competence bonus on the attack rolls for every
      four psychic warrior levels you have.
