      <p><em>You can burn your mind and soul to preserve your life.</em></p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> As a free action, when you are reduced to 0
      or fewer hit points, you can heal 1 hit point by taking 1 ability burn
      damage to one of your three mental ability scores: Intelligence, Wisdom,
      and Charisma. For example, you may heal 1 hit point by taking 1 point of
      ability burn to your Intelligence.

      </p>

      <p>You can recover additional hit points for a proportional cost to
      Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma. If you expend your psionic focus when
      you use Feast of Folly, you heal 2 hit points for each point of ability
      burn you take. The amount you can heal this way in one use of Feast of
      Folly can not be higher than your HD and you cannot use this feat more
      than once per round.

      </p>

      <p>For example, Telthor is reduced to -5 hp. He decides to take 5 points
      of ability burn and expends his psionic focus to heal 10 hit points. He
      then takes 3 points of Intelligence burn and 2 points of Charisma burn,
      leaving his Wisdom untouched.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> Only intelligent, sentient creatures can use
      this feat. Any creature immune to ability damage or ability burn is unable
      to benefit from this feat.

      </p>
