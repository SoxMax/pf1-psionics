    value: >-
      <p><em>You manifest powers that deal damage of the void instead of an
      energy type.</em></p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Manifester level 5th.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit: </strong>To use this feat, you must expend your
      psionic focus. When you manifest a power that deals damage of your active
      energy type, but instead of using your active energy type, it draws upon
      the void itself, creating an inverse of energy. The power deals the same
      amount of damage, but this damage is untyped and not subject to energy
      resistance. Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power by
      4. The power’s total cost cannot exceed your manifester level.
