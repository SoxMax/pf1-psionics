      <p><em>Your words can cause fear and hope in even the dead, promising
      peace or judgment.</em></p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong><a
      href="/wiki/Athanatism_(Psion_Discipline)" title="Athanatism (Psion
      Discipline)">Conduit</a> level 5th.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You gain a +5 bonus on the first check you
      make to control or deceive a given spirit each day. If you succeed on this
      check, that spirit suffers a -2 penalty on saving throws against conduit
      powers and effects that you create for 24 hours. If you fail this check,
      any attempts you make to influence that ghost or spirit for the next week
      instead suffer a -5 penalty.

      </p>

      <p>This penalty for a given spirit decreases by one for each day that
      passes in which you do not attempt to control or deceive that spirit, to a
      minimum of 0.
