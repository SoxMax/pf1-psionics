  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Your melee or ranged attack overcomes your

      opponent’s alignment-based damage reduction and

      deals additional damage.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite: </strong>Base attack bonus +6.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit: </strong>When you take this feat, choose either

      chaos, good, evil or law. (Your choice must match one

      of your alignment components.) Once you’ve made this

      alignment choice, it cannot be changed.

      </p>

      <p>As long as you maintain psionic focus, your attack is

      treated as either a good, evil, chaotic, or lawful attack

      (depending on your original choice) for the purpose of

      overcoming damage reduction.

      </p>

      <p>You may choose to expend your psionic focus when

      making an attack to power this feat’s secondary ability.

      When you make a successful melee or ranged attack in

      this fashion, you deal an extra 2d6 points of damage of

      the type you originally selected if your target is of the

      opposed alignment. This attack is still treated as the

      appropriate alignment type. You must decide whether

      or not to use this ability prior to making an attack. If

      your attack misses, you still expend your psionic focus.

      </p>

      <p><br /></p>

      <p>You can switch the alignment of your attacks.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Aligned Attack. 

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You can expend a use of mythic power as a
      swift action to change the alignment choice for the Aligned Attack feat.
      The alignment chosen must still match one of your alignment components. 

      </p>
