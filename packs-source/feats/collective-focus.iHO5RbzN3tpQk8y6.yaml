      <p><em>You can store a psionic focus within your collective's minds for
      your use.</em></p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Collective class feature.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit: </strong>You can psionically focus your collective
      itself, in the same manner in which you gain psionic focus normally. At
      any time when you need to expend

      your psionic focus on an ability that would affect a member of your
      collective (including you), you can expend this psionic focus instead. At
      any time when you

      need to maintain psionic focus for an ability that affects a member of
      your collective (including you), you can use your collective’s psionic
      focus instead. Psionically focusing your collective works just like
      focusing your own mind.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Special: </strong>You cannot benefit from this feat at the same
      time as <a href="/wiki/Psicrystal_Containment" title="Psicrystal
      Containment">Psicrystal Containment</a> or <a href="/wiki/Deep_Focus"
      title="Deep Focus">Deep Focus</a>. If you have more than one of these, you
      may only have a single additional psionic focus at any given time.

      </p>
