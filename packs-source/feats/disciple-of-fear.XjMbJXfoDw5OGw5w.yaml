  description:
    value: |-
      <p>You have studied the intricacies of terror and fear,
      being able to use this knowledge to further your own
      powers beyond what would normally be available for
      you.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Prerequisites: </strong>Devastating touch class feature,
      terrors class feature.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Benefit: </strong>For the purpose of your devastating touch
      and terror class features, your effective class level
      increases by 4. This benefit can’t increase your effective
      class level to higher than your Hit Dice. However, even
      if you can’t benefit from the full bonus immediately, if
      you later gain Hit Dice in levels of other classes, you
      might be able to apply the rest of the bonus. This feat
      does not affect your terrors known or give you further
      uses of your terrors, but increases it for the purposes of
      augmentation and save DC’s.
