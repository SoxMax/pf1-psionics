  description:
    value: >-
      <p><em>You are able to siphon the physical strength from members of your
      collective.</em></p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Collective class feature,
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1-psionics.feats.Item.lPBKCtxFvagvrV6T]{Mind Parasite}.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit: </strong>For short bursts of time, you can drain
      strength from those in your collective to enhance your own strength. Up to
      3 times per day, as a swift action, you

      can give every member of your collective a –1 penalty on Strength checks,
      melee attacks and damage rolls and gain a +1 bonus per member to your
      Strength checks,

      melee attacks and damage rolls. Both the penalty and bonus last for a
      number of rounds equal to your key ability modifier.

      </p>
