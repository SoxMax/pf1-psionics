      <p>You burn your life force to strengthen your powers.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit: </strong>While manifesting a power, you can increase

      your effective manifester level by one, but in so doing

      you take 1d8 points of damage. At 8th level, you can

      choose to increase your effective manifester level by

      two, but you take 3d8 points of damage. At 15th level,

      you can increase your effective manifester level by

      three, but you take 5d8 points of damage.

      </p>

      <p>The effective increase in manifester level increases

      the number of power points you can expend on a single

      power manifestation, as well as increasing all manifester

      level-dependent effects, such as range, duration, and

      overcoming power resistance.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Normal: </strong>Your manifester level is equal to your total

      levels in classes that manifest powers.

      </p>

      <p><br /></p>

      <p>You have learned to push yourself harder to increase your manifesting
      power.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Overchannel.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You can increase your manifester level when
      using Overchannel by half your tier (minimum 1), but doing so adds an
      additional 1d8 points of damage per manifester level added
