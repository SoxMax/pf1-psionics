      <p><em>Your false judgments bring real hope and the promise of a better
      future.</em></p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong><a href="/wiki/Divine_Judgment"
      title="Divine Judgment">Divine Judgment</a>, <a
      href="/wiki/Athanatism_(Psion_Discipline)" title="Athanatism (Psion
      Discipline)">conduit</a> level 5th.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When you succeed on a check to use the Divine
      Judgment feat, you may also attempt to use Diplomacy to change the
      attitude of the target (including the bonus from Divine Judgment) as a
      free action. Once per day, while the target is at least indifferent
      towards you, you may manifest <em><a>naija's compelling voice</a></em> on
      that target as a psi-like ability, with a DC equal to 12 + your Charisma
      modifier and a manifester level equal to your HD, ignoring normal
      immunities to mind-affecting effects.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> You may not use both <a
      href="/wiki/Condemning_Glare" title="Condemning Glare">Condemning
      Glare</a> and Words of Salvation on the same target within a 24-hour
      period.
