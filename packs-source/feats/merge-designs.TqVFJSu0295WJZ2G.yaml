      <p><em>Your tattoos blend together into a greater pattern.</em></p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong><a href="/wiki/Merge_Designs"
      title="Merge Designs">Merge Designs</a></p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You can wear a number of additional psionic
      tattoos equal to your mythic tier. In addition, your psionic tattoos are
      never at risk of simultaneously activating due to having too many tattoos
      on your body; tattoos beyond your limit are simply inert until such time
      as you remove or tap other tattoos. You can expend one use of mythic power
      while tapping a psionic tattoo to add your mythic tier to the manifester
      level of the tattoo tapped.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Normal:</strong> A character can only safely wear twenty
      psionic tattoos.
