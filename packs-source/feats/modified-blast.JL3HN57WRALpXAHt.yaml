      <p>You have learned to alter the nature of your surge

      blast by spending your psionic power.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites: </strong>Surge blast class feature, manifester

      level 3rd.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit: </strong>When you activate your surge blast, you

      gain the following augment options. Like augmenting

      a power, augmenting a surge blast is limited to your

      manifester level. You can also choose to invoke a wild

      surge when using your surge blast, using the power

      from the wild surge to pay for augments to the surge

      blast, but suffer the standard risk of psychic enervation

      for invoking a wild surge.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Augment: </strong>You can augment your surge blast in one of

      the following ways.

      </p><ul><li>If you spend 2 additional power points, your surge blast deals
      splash damage.</li><li>If you spend 3 additional power points, your surge
      blast is instead a 5 ft. emanation centered on you and creatures in the
      affected area gain a Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 your manifester level + your
      Charisma modifier) to take half damage.</li><li>If you spend 4 additional
      power points, your surge blast deals half damage, but damages all
      creatures in a 30 ft. line.</li><li>If you spend 4 additional power
      points, your surge blast is empowered, dealing 50% additional
      damage.</li><li>If you spend 4 additional power points, your surge blast
      is a 15 ft. cone effect instead of a ranged touch attack, and creatures in
      the affected area gain a Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 your manifester level +
      your Charisma modifier) to take half damage.</li><li>If you spend 4
      additional power points, your surge blast affects all creatures within a
      10 ft. radius of the targeted creature and creatures in the affected area
      gain a Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 your manifester level + your Charisma
      modifier) to take half damage.</li><li>If you spend 6 additional power
      points, your surge blast is instead a 10 ft. emanation centered on you
      andcreatures in the affected area gain a Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 your
      manifester level + your Charisma modifier) to take half damage.</li></ul>

      <p><br /></p>

      <p>Your surge blasts are more dangerous than others.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Modified Blast.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When you augment your surge blast, you add
      your mythic tier to the number of power points spent. These points can
      exceed the normal limit of power points spent augmenting your surge blast.
      In addition, you can expend one use of mythic power while augmenting a
      surge blast to have the damage of the surge blast maximized and the DC (if
      any) increased by half your mythic tier (minimum 1.)
