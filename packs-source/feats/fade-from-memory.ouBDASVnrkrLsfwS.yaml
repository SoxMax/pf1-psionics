      <p><em>You can vanish from the immediate memory of those around
      you.</em></p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong><a href="/wiki/Divert_Perception"
      title="Divert Perception">Divert Perception</a> feat, Stealth 8 ranks.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When you use Stealth to hide, you can expend
      your psionic focus to cause creatures within close range (25 feet + 5 feet
      per two character levels) to forget about you until you reappear. Only
      creatures who failed to see through your initial Stealth check are
      affected, and an affected creature can make a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your
      character level + your highest mental ability score modifier) to resist
      this effect. When you expend your psionic focus in order to hide at the
      end of your movement using the Divert Perception feat, you can also use
      this one as part of the same action, without having to expend psionic
      focus a second time.
