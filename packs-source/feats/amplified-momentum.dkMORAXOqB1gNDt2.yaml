    value: >-
      <p><em>You can amplify your augmented strikes with momentum, or recycle it
      into your evasiveness.</em></p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Momentum class feature.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit: </strong>When you spend momentum to amplify an attack,
      you choose to gain one of the following:

      </p><ul><li>Your momentum deals an additional 1 point of damage per die
      added to the attack. Like momentum, the additional damage from this feat
      is not multiplied by critical hits and similar effects.</li><li>You gain a
      +1 dodge bonus to AC and on Reflex saves for 1 round, that increases by 1
      for every point of momentum you spent (to a maximum of your Intelligence
      modifier). These bonuses stack with the dodge bonuses you gain from
      momentum normally, but their total cannot exceed a maximum of your
      Intelligence modifier + 2.</li></ul>
