    value: >-
      <p><em>You form your mind blade with a touch of psychic power, warping its
      function to match your implement's.</em></p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Enhanced mind blade class feature, <a
      href="/wiki/Occultist" title="Occultist">occultist</a> level 1st.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Your occultist levels and your soulknife
      levels stack to determine the enhancement bonus granted by your enhanced
      mind blade class feature and the maximum enhancement bonus of your mind
      blade. In addition, you can channel your mind blade with the power of one
      of the implement on your person, reducing its enhancement bonus by +1 to
      tie it to that implement's school. Once per round, when you hit an
      opponent with your mind blade, you can activate one of that implement's
      focus powers that is normally used as a standard action as a free action,
      paying 1 extra point of mental focus to do so. If the focus power is an
      effect that targets an opponent, it must target the opponent you hit. Your
      mind blade can be reduced to a +0 enhancement bonus by this feat without
      needing to reshape it, and you can return it to its normal enhancement
      bonus (breaking its link with the implement) as a free action.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Normal:</strong> If your mind blade is reduced to a +0
      enhancement bonus, you must reshape it to have a valid combination of
      enhancement bonus and weapon special abilities.

      </p>
