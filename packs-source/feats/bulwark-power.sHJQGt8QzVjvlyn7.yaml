    value: >-
      <p><em>You manifest a personal power so that it takes effect at a later
      time.</em></p>

      <p><strong>Benefit: </strong>To use this feat, you must expend your
      psionic focus. You manifest a personal psionic power that instead of
      triggering immediately, instead triggers the next time you are attacked
      (someone makes a successful attack roll, or you fail a saving throw).
      Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power by 2. The
      power’s total cost cannot exceed your manifester level.

      </p>
