      </p><p>There are those who are meant to serve, and those who are meant to
      rule. A highlord stands proudly as one of the latter, joining minds
      together in a powerful network driven by his will and goals above all
      else. His true power shows itself when fighting alongside his allies, but
      if deprived of followers, the highlord can still fight by invading the
      minds of his enemies and briefly bending them to his will. </p><p>Unlike
      other telepaths, a highlord's power runs far deeper into both his mind and
      those of others. For a highlord, the touching of minds is a two-way street
      — just as he draws on the minds of his subjects, they get a glimpse into
      his thoughts and desires. The strong connection of a highlord's collective
      allows him to avail himself to the talents of both his allies and any
      enemies unfortunate enough to fall under his sway. When a highlord speaks,
      others obey. What a highlord decrees becomes fact, manipulating the course
      of battles, whether they take place in the mind or outside of it.
      </p><p>Each highlord chooses his own path, using the tenets they follow as
      a guideline to further their own goals. A highlord can drive his soldiers
      to seek victory at any cost, or exploit them for temporary advantages in
      combat. Those with evil in their hearts may treat their allies like pieces
      in the game of battle to be sacrificed if necessary. However, benevolent
      highlords may value the lives of those under his command, and consider
      them as friends or assets too valuable to discard. Instead, such highlords
      choose to use their talents to guide their allies towards a mutual goal. A
      highlord can drive his collective to step over the bodies of their fallen
      comrades, or to work together and persevere as one. </p><p><b>Role:</b>
      The highlord is a battlefield leader who guides the minds of his allies
      and grasps the minds of his enemies. By forcing enemies into his
      collective, he can inconvenience or incapacitate them, or direct his
      allies with pinpoint precision. Through his psionic abilities, he can
      fight alone or strengthen his party, ruling the battlefield regardless of
      his choice in tenets. </p><p><b>Alignment:</b> Any. Though certain
      alignments may gravitate toward different tenets, any given individual may
      channel the tenets of a highlord towards whichever goals they desire.
      </p><p><b>Starting Wealth:</b> 5d6 x 10 gp (175 gp). In addition, each
      character begins play with an outfit worth 10 gp or less. </p><p><b>Hit
      Die:</b> d8 </p><p><b>Class Skills:</b> The highlord's class skills are
      Autohypnosis (Wis), Bluff (Cha), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Heal (Wis),
      Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (Nobility) (Int), Knowledge (Psionics) (Int),
      Knowledge (Religion) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride
      (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).
