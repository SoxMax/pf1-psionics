  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 4th level, and every three tactician levels thereafter, a tactician
      learns a new tactical strategy, granting him special abilities in combat.
      Unless specified otherwise, using a strategy is a swift action that does
      not provoke attacks of opportunity. Strategies are often orders or
      suggestions that the tactician issues to members of his collective. A
      tactician may not direct a strategy at himself unless a strategy specifies
      otherwise.

      </p><p>Strategies may be used a number of times per day equal to 3 + the
      tactician's Charisma modifier.

      </p>
