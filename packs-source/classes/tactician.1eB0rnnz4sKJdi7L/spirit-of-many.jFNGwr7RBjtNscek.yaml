    value: >-
      <p>A tactician of 2nd level gains special abilities when manifesting
      powers with the Network descriptor. He can manifest these powers on any
      member of his collective, even if they are out of the power's range or
      would normally be immune to the power. Whenever a tactician manifests a
      power with the Network descriptor targeting only members of his
      collective, the power loses the mind-affecting descriptor (if it had it)
      and is treated as a supernatural ability (bypassing Power Resistance and
      becoming immune to dispel attempts), although it still provokes an attacks
      of opportunity to manifest as normal. Network powers manifest only on
      members of the collective never allow saving throws – their saving throw
      entry becomes “None,” although if the power specifies a subsequent saving
      throw, subjects attempt those saves normally. The tactician also adds the
      following augment to all powers with the network descriptor:
