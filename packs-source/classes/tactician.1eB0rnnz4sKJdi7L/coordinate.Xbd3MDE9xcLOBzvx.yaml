      - Tactician
  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 6th level, as long as the tactician maintains psionic focus, he may
      share any one teamwork feat he has with one member of his collective
      within line of sight and line of effect. Declaring which member of the
      collective gains the teamwork feat is a free action that can only be done
      once per round. The ally's positioning and actions must still meet the
      prerequisites listed in the teamwork feat to receive the listed bonus, but
      the ally need not meet the feat prerequisites to gain the benefit.
