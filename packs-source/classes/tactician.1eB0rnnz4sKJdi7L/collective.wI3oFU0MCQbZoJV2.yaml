  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A tactician learns to use psionic power to connect willing minds
      through an internal network that strengthens their psychic bonds. As a
      standard action, a tactician can join any number of willing targets into
      his collective (up to his limit, see below). The tactician must have line
      of sight to each target, each target must have a Wisdom score of at least
      1, and all targets must be within Medium range (100 ft. + 10 ft. per class
      level). The collective can contain up to his key ability modifier or half
      his tactician level, whichever is higher. The tactician is always
      considered a member of his own collective, and does not count against this
      limit.

      </p><p>The tactician can choose to remove a member as a free action on his
      turn, and any member can voluntarily leave the collective as a free action
      on their turn. Any member whose Wisdom drops to zero or who moves out of
      range of the collective is automatically removed. If a member enters a
      null psionics field, the connection to the collective is suppressed until
      the member leaves the field. A member who leaves the collective for any
      reason immediately loses any and all benefits they may have gained from
      being a member. A tactician is aware of the status of his collective and
      can, roughly, sense the presence of each member, although beyond telling
      if such a creature is still a member, this has no mechanical benefit until
      higher levels (see telepathy below).

      </p><p>A tactician can manifest certain powers through his collective. If
      a tactician power specifies one or more willing targets (or is harmless)
      and has a range greater than personal, he can manifest this power on a
      member of his collective regardless of the range of the actual power. All
      other non-range restrictions still apply. He may manifest any power with
      the Network Descriptor this way, regardless of their actual ranges or
      targets. If he is capable of manifesting powers or casting spells from a
      different class (as is the case for a multiclass tactician), any
      compatible spell or power with a range greater than touch can also be used
      through the collective.

      </p><p>If a member of the collective dies, the member is removed from the
      collective and the tactician must make a Fortitude save (DC 15) or lose 1
      power point for every Hit Die of the fallen member or be sickened for an
      equal number of rounds.

      </p><p>At 15th level, a tactician's collective range is limitless on the
      same plane as the tactician

      </p><p>At 19th level, a tactician's range reaches even across other planes
      and dimensions.
