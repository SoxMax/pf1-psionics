  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Upon achieving 20th level, a tactician has learned how to turn his
      collective into a truly cohesive battle unit. The tactician may use two
      daily uses of his strategy ability and grant all of his allies an insight
      bonus on attack and damage rolls, armor class, and saving throws equal to
      his intelligence for two minutes. This ability may not be used if the
      tactician is not engaged in combat.
