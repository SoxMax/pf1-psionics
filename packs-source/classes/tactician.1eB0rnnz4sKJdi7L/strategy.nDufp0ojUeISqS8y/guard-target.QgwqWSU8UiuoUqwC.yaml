  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The tactician directs a member of his collective to guard a specific
      target (which may be the tactician, but not the directed member), granting
      the directed member a +1 competence bonus to attack rolls. In addition,
      the directed member can spend an attack of opportunity to redirect an
      attack made at the target as if it was made at him, even if the attack
      itself would not normally have provoked an attack of opportunity. Any time
      the directed member redirects an attack in this fashion, the tactician
      gains a cumulative +1 bonus to his next attack against the source of the
      redirected attack. This effect lasts a number of rounds equal to the
      tactician's Charisma modifier, although the tactician's bonus resets at
      the end of his turn. If the directed member would not normally be able to
      make an attack of opportunity, for example, if they already made one and
      do not possess the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text"
      href="https://www.aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Combat%20Reflexes">Combat
      Reflexes</a> feat, they may not redirect attacks. At 8th level and every
      four tactician levels thereafter, the competence bonus on attack rolls
      increases by 1.</p>
