  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The tactician can direct a member of his collective to hold their
      ground, granting the directed member a +1 dodge bonus to AC and a +1
      competence bonus to attack rolls for a number of rounds equal to the
      tactician's Charisma modifier. For each round the directed member does not
      move from the spot, the tactician may immediately take a free move action
      on the same round, but must move toward the directed member in as direct a
      manner as possible. The tactician gains a +1 dodge bonus to his AC during
      this move. At 8th level and every four tactician levels thereafter, the
      dodge bonuses and the competence bonus to attack rolls increase by 1.</p>
