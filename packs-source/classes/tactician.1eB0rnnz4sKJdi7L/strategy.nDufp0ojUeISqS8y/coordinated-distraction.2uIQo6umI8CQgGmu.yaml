  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The tactician can direct a member of his collective to attack a single
      enemy, granting the directed member a +1 competence bonus on the attack
      roll for a number of rounds equal to the tactician's Charisma modifier. If
      the directed member performs the attack, regardless of where the directed
      member is in relation to the tactician, the tactician treats the enemy as
      being flanked and the tactician may make a single melee attack against the
      targeted enemy as an immediate action. The tactician may only make one
      such attack per use of this strategy. Alternatively, the tactician may
      make the initial attack against the targeted enemy, gaining the +1
      competence bonus instead of the directed member, and the directed member
      treats the target as being flanked, but using the strategy in this fashion
      makes it a full round action instead of a swift action. At 8th level and
      every four tactician levels thereafter, the competence bonus on the attack
      roll increases by 1.</p>
