  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The tacician is able to direct his allies to coordinating their attacks
      upon a single target to devastating effect. As a swift action, the
      tactician can declare one target within his line of sight as the primary
      foe. All members of the tactician's collective, including the tactician
      himself gain a +1 insight bonus to attacks against the primary foe until
      the beginning of the tactician's next turn. At 5th level and every four
      levels thereafter, this bonus increases by 1.

      </p><p>This ability may be used a number of times per day equal to 3 + the
      tacticians Intelligence modifier.
