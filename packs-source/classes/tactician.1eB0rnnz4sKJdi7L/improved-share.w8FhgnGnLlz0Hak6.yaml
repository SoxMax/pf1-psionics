  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A tactician learns special techniques when manifesting powers with the
      Shared descriptor. Beginning at 5th level, the tactician may maintain two
      powers with the Shared descriptor at any time instead of only one. Should
      he manifest a third power with the Shared descriptor, the tactician can
      choose which of the maintained Shared powers ends immediately.

      </p><p>Every six tactician levels thereafter (11th, 17th), the tactician
      may maintain an additional power with the Shared descriptor before a
      maintained power with the Shared descriptor expires.

      </p>
