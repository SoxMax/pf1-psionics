  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 6th level, a voyager can react to danger before her senses
      would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, nor
      does she lose her Dex bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. She still
      loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A voyager with this
      ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent
      successfully uses the feint action (see Combat) against her.If a voyager
      already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains
      improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.
