      <p>At 5th level, a voyager's journey can extend to the Astral Plane and
      beyond. The voyager gains <a href="/wiki/Astral_Traveler" title="Astral
      Traveler">astral traveler</a> as a bonus power known, if she does not know
      it already. In addition, voyager can use <a href="/wiki/Astral_Caravan"
      title="Astral Caravan">astral caravan</a> at will as a psi-like ability.
      Unlike a normal psi-like ability, the manifesting time for this effect is
      1 hour (like a normal <i>astral caravan</i> power).

      </p><p>Unlike with a normal astral caravan, the voyager can start and lead
      a caravan even if her companions are not maintaining hand to hand contact.
      As long as her companions remain within close range (25 feet + 5 feet per
      2 class levels), the voyager can maintain the astral caravan and move them
      along with her as if she were maintaining hand to hand contact with them.

      </p><p>At 10th level, a voyager grows more accurate in navigating the
      Astral Plane. On a successful navigation to a plane, the voyager is able
      to choose what direction the caravan appears in relation to her intended
      destination.She also reduces the distance her group appears from her
      intended destination by a degree of 10 (so if she would have appeared
      1,000 miles from her destination, she would instead appear 100 miles from
      it).

      </p><p>At 15th level, a voyager can locate her destination with greater
      precision. On a successful navigation to a plane, the voyager can reduce
      the distance her caravan appears from her intended destination to 1 mile.
      In addition, she halves the time it takes to make a Knowledge (Planes)
      check while traveling through this ability. This ability stacks with time
      saver, potentially reducing the time it takes to make each Knowledge
      (Planes) check to 3 hours.
