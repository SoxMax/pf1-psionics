  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 9th level and higher, a voyager can no longer be flanked. This
      defense denies a rogue the ability to sneak attack the voyager by flanking
      her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the
      target has voyager levels. If a character already has uncanny dodge (see
      above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny
      dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the
      character.
