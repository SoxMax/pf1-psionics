  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 16th level, a voyager gains unique insight into the nonlinear nature
      of time, and can reach back to adjust one of the decisions she made in the
      past. Once per day, by meditating for 10 minutes, the voyager can use <a
      href="/wiki/Psychic_Reformation" title="Psychic Reformation">psychic
      reformation</a> as a psi-like ability. She can only target herself with
      this effect, takes no penalties from it. In addition to the power's normal
      effect, the voyager can also change her parallel actions known when she
      uses this ability.
