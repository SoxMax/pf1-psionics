  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A voyager's future and alternate selves can act in some capacity on
      their present self's reality. Their activities are represented through a
      unique turn known as a parallel turn. Whenever a voyager rolls initiative,
      she also rolls initiative for her parallel turn. She makes a second
      initiative roll at a –8 penalty. This result is noted as the voyager's
      parallel turn. If the voyager has another ability that allows her to
      reroll initiative checks or roll additional dice, she can apply them to
      either roll.

      </p><p>A voyager's parallel turn is not a true turn, and as such, the
      voyager herself does not act normally during it. Instead, on the parallel
      turn's initiative count each round, the voyager can use a single parallel
      action she knows (see below). If she wishes, the voyager can delay the
      initiative count of her parallel turn, just like a normal turn. At 3rd
      level and every 4 levels thereafter, the voyager gains a +4 bonus to her
      parallel initiative roll, up to a +12 bonus at 19th level.

      </p><p>Outside of combat, when not tracking initiative orders, a voyager's
      parallel turn can be considered the same as her own (letting her freely
      use her parallel actions), but the confusion of combat quickly
      desynchronizes the voyager and her counterparts when initiative is rolled.
