    value: >-
      <p>At 8th level, the voyager can gain information on the timeline of a
      creature and use her foreknowledge to evade their attacks. As a swift
      action, the voyager can choose a creature within close range (25 feet + 5
      feet per 2 class levels). Against this creature, even if she does not have
      any momentum, the voyager is treated as if she had her maximum bonus to AC
      and Reflex from momentum with an additional +2 bonus. In addition, once
      per round, the voyager can force the affected creature to reroll an attack
      roll that is made against her. The voyager has these effects against that
      creature until she chooses another creature with this ability. The voyager
      can only maintain these effects against one creature at a time; using this
      ability again removes the effects she gained against its previous target.
