  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 11th level, a voyager can continue their exploration of time for as
      long as she desires. A voyager ceases to age, though she may begin aging
      normally if she wishes to. This is a decision that the voyager can change
      at any time. The voyager cannot be magically aged, unless she allows it.
