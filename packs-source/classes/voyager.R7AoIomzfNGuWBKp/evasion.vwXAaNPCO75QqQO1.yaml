  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 2nd level, a voyager can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with
      great agility. If the voyager makes a successful Reflex saving throw
      against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save,
      she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the voyager is
      wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless voyager does not gain the
      benefit of evasion.
