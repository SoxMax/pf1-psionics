  description:
    value: >-
      <p>An aegis of 20th level has learned to become one with his suit. His
      suit cannot be dispelled or removed against his will by any means,
      although his astral suit ability still does not function within areas
      where psionics do not work, such as a null psionics field.

      </p><p>In addition, the aegis can spend two daily uses of his reconfigure
      ability, to alter all of the customizations on his astral suit.

      </p><p>Finally, once per day, the aegis can boost his cannibalize suit
      ability, healing all of his hit point damage, although he cannot reform
      his suit for ten minutes after using this ability, rather than the
      standard one minute.

      </p>
