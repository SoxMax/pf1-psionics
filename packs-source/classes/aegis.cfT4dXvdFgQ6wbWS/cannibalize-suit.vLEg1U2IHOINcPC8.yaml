  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 12th level, an aegis learns to convert the psionic energy
      used to create his suit into healing power. Once per day as a standard
      action, he can dismiss his astral suit and heal a number of hit points
      equal to his customization pool. The aegis cannot reform his suit again
      for one minute after using this ability. Every two levels thereafter, the
      aegis can use this ability an additional time per day. Additional
      customization points gained from Augment Suit are not counted for this
      ability.
