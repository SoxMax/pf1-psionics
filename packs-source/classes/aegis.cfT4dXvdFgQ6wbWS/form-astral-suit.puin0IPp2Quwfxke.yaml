  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Every aegis learns to draw forth ectoplasm and form an astral suit
      around their form. The aegis can select from three different types when
      forming his astral suit – skin, armor, or juggernaut. An aegis is always
      considered to be proficient with his astral suit, even if he does not have
      the appropriate armor proficiency. The amount of time forming this astral
      suit takes depends on the type of suit being formed. Different astral suit
      forms grant different free customizations. These free customizations never
      count against the aegis's total number of customization points spent on
      his astral suit.

      </p><p>The aegis chooses the appearance of his astral suit, although its
      shape must reflect the selections the aegis has chosen: astral skin would
      cover the aegis like a psychoactive skin, astral juggernaut would appear
      to cover the aegis like plate armor, etc. An astral suit can be dismissed
      as a free action.

      </p><p>An astral suit does not function in areas where psionics do not
      work, such as a null psionics field. Dismiss ectoplasm can be used against
      an astral suit; treat the manifester level as the aegis's class level,
      although the aegis can simply form his astral suit again on his next turn.
