  description:
    value: >-
      <p>An aegis is capable of repairing mundane items, restoring 2 hit points
      of damage to the touched item as a standard action usable at will. If the
      object has the broken condition, this condition is removed if the object
      is restored to at least half its original hit points. All of the pieces of
      an object must be present for this ability to function. This ability has
      no effect on objects that have been warped or otherwise transmuted, but it
      can still repair damage done to such items. </p>
