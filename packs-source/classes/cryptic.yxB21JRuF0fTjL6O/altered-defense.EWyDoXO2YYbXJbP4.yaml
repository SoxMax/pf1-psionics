  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A cryptic learns early on to modify the patterns around her to grant
      her protection as a swift action. The cryptic chooses from the options
      below and may only have one such effect active at any given time. The
      cryptic can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 +
      her Intelligence modifier. The cryptic can maintain this ability as long
      as she wants as long as she has rounds available, or dismiss it at any
      time as a free action.

      </p>

      <ul><li><i>Absorb: </i>The cryptic gains DR 1/-.</li>

      <li><i>Deflect: </i>The cryptic gains a +1 dodge bonus to his AC.</li>

      <li><i>Retaliate: </i>The cryptic gains a +1 bonus on his attack rolls
      against any opponent that successfully hit him since his last
      turn.</li></ul>

      <p>Every four cryptic levels thereafter, this bonus increases by 1 (to 2
      at 5th level, 3 at 9th level, 4 at 13th level, and 5 at 17th level).
