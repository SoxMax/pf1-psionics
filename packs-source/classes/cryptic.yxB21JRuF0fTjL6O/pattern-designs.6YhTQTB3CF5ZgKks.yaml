  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Unlike normal manifesters, a cryptic manipulates the world around her
      by creating tattoos and patterns that alters reality in different ways.
      Cryptic powers show up on the cryptic's body in the form of tattoos. The
      cryptic's known powers can be identified via Spellcraft checks with a DC
      equal to 10 + double the power's level. These tattoos do not count against
      the number of psionic tattoos that the cryptic can safely wear.

      </p><p>When a cryptic manifests one of her powers, it creates a visual
      pattern of energy during the action taken to manifest the pattern. While
      the cryptic's powers have the normal displays for psionic powers –
      auditory, mental, and the like – this visual pattern unique to the cryptic
      cannot be suppressed as normal displays can be suppressed.

      </p>
