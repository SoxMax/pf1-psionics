  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A cryptic can 'fold' the pattern of a trap she has personally crafted,
      compressing the trap into a light-weight projectile which can be thrown at
      a later time. As a standard action, the cryptic can throw the folded trap
      at an unoccupied square up to 30 feet away. No attack roll is necessary
      and the trap is immediately 'unfolded' and ready to be triggered as
      normal. The trap affected must have a CR no greater than half the
      cryptic's level (minimum 1). A trap that has been folded cannot be folded
      again, even if it was not triggered after being thrown. The cryptic must
      have the Quick Trapsmith insight before selecting this insight.</p>
