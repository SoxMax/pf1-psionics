      <p>A wilder can let her passion and emotion rise to the surface in a wild
      surge when she manifests a power. During a wild surge, a wilder gains
      phenomenal psionic strength, but may harm herself by the reckless use of
      her power (see psychic enervation, below).

      </p><p>A wilder can choose to invoke a wild surge whenever she manifests a
      power. When she does so, she gains +1 to her manifester level with that
      manifestation of the power. The manifester level boost gives her the
      ability to augment her powers to a higher degree than she otherwise could;
      however, she pays no extra power point for this wild surge. Instead, the
      additional 1 power point that would normally be required to augment the
      power is effectively supplied by the wild surge.

      </p><p>Level-dependent power effects are also improved, depending on the
      power a wilder manifests with her wild surge.

      </p><p>This improvement in manifester level does not grant her any other
      benefits outside of the manifestation (she gains no higher-level class
      abilities, for instance).

      </p><p>She cannot use the <a href="/wiki/Overchannel"
      title="Overchannel">Overchannel</a> psionic feat and invoke her wild surge
      at the same time.

      </p><p>At 3rd level, a wilder boosts her manifester level by two instead
      of one. At 7th level, she boosts her manifester level by three; at 11th
      level, by four; at 15th level, by five; and at 19th level, by six. The
      wilder always wild surges for the maximum amount possible, for unleashing
      emotions in the fashion of a wild surge does not lend itself to using
      finesse.

      </p><p>In all cases, the wild surge effectively pays the extra power point
      cost that is normally required to augment the power by this additional
      amount; only the standard power point cost is subtracted from the wilder's
      power point reserve. For example, if Alrik the 8th level wilder were to
      invoke his wild surge when manifesting a power, he would spend between 1
      and 8 power points as normal, but the power would manifest at 11th
      manifester level and behave as if he had spent 3 more on it than normal.

      </p><p>The wilder can expend her psionic focus to manifest a psionic power
      without expending any power points, powering the manifestation with only
      her wild surge. She manifests this power as if all power points were paid
      by her wild surge ability. This results in the power being manifested as
      if the base power point cost of the power was paid, along with
      augmentation equal to her wild surge amount, but she may not augment the
      power beyond the amount of her wild surge, and when checking for psychic
      enervation, the chance to be overcome doubles to 30%. A wilder must wait
      10 minutes after wild surging in this fashion before she can do so again.
      If the wilder suffers psychic enervation and loses more power points than
      she has available, she instead loses 3 hit points for every power point
      lost.
