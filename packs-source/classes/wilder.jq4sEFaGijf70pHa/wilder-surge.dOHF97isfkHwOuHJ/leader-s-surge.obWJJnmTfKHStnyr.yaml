  description:
    value: "<p><strong>Wild Surge and Psychic Enervation:</strong> For the leader wilder, the rush of emotions is at its highest when amongst allies and friends. From their camaraderie, she draws renewed strength and in combat, their danger drives her emotions to almost paralyzing heights, sometimes spilling over into her aura. A leader wilder overcome by\_psychic enervation\_is\_shaken\_for a number of rounds equal to the level of wild surge used and loses a number of power points equal to her normal manifester level (the increase in manifester level from her wild surge does not increase the number of power points lost), and each ally inside her aura (see Bond Benefit, below) must make a\_Will save (DC 10 + ½ wilder level + wilder’s\_Charisma\_modifier) or be\_shaken\_until the end of their next turn. If the leader wilder suffers\_psychic enervation\_again while still suffering from a previous\_psychic enervation, the penalties do not stack, but the duration resets.</p><p><strong>Surge Bond:</strong> The leader wilder gains the\_Surging Aura feat as a bonus feat.</p><p><strong>Improved Surge Bond:</strong> A leader wilder’s ability to share her surging power with her allies reaches a new and profound level of understanding and as she surges, so do her allies. Beginning at 5th level, the wilder increases her surging aura radius by 5’ and whenever she gains the benefits of her surging euphoria, all allies within her surging aura radius also gain the benefits of surging euphoria. Every four levels beyond 5th (9th, 13th, and 17th level), the range of her surging aura radius increases by 5’ (to 20’ at 9th level, etc.).</p>"
