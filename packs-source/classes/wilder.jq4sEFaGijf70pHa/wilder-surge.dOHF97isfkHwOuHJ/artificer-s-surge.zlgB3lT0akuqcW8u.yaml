  description:
    value: "<p><strong>Wild Surge and Psychic Enervation:</strong> The artificer wilder learns to channel her emotions into psionic items, allowing her to increase the power of items as well as her own powers. The artificer wilder may wild surge while manifesting a power from a power completion or power trigger item and treat the power being manifested as if it was augmented by her wild surge. The wilder must be capable of activating the item normally to apply her wild surge to the item. The item surged must make a\_Fortitude\_save (DC 10 + the wild surge bonus added) or lose one charge if a charged item, lose an additional daily use if an item restricted by daily uses, or its psionic power is suppressed for 24 hours if it is not restricted by charged or daily uses, and the artificer wilder suffers a 30% chance of\_psychic enervation. This method of wild surging functions in all other ways identically to a standard wild surge. An artificer wilder overcome by\_psychic enervation\_is\_dazed\_until the end of her next turn and loses a number of power points equal to her normal manifester level (the increase in manifester level from her wild surge does not increase the number of power points lost).</p><p><strong>Surge Bond:</strong> You gain one Item Creation feat as a bonus feat. You must still meet the prerequisites of the feat.</p><p><strong>Improved Surge Bond:</strong> At 5th level, the artificer wilder gain one Item Creation feat as a bonus feat at 5th level and every four levels thereafter (9th, 13th, etc). She must still meet the prerequisites of the feat.</p>"
