  description:
    value: "<p><strong>Wild Surge and Psychic Enervation:</strong> An efficient wilder has learned to control her emotions and use the surge of energy in a more efficient manner, rather than as a huge blast of power. When an efficient wilder invokes a wild surge, she instead reduces the cost of the power manifested by the level of the wild surge (to a minimum cost of 0) instead of increasing her manifester level and adding power points to augment the power. This reduction in cost does not stack with other similar effects, such as that by a torc of power preservation. The power is still treated as having spent the full amount of power points when determining the number of power points the wilder can spend on manifesting it. When an efficient wilder suffers psychic enervation, she loses a number of power points equal to her manifester level and is\_staggered\_until the end of her next turn.</p><p><strong>Surge Bond:</strong> The efficient wilder gains\_Enervation Fortitude\_as a bonus feat at 1st level.</p><p><strong>Improved Surge Bond:</strong> At 5th level, when the efficient wilder expends her psionic focus to manifest a power without having to spend any power points, the chance for enervation is reduced by 5%. In addition, the time until she can expend her psionic focus to manifest a power without having to spend any power points is reduced by 1 minute. Every 5 levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th), the time between uses is reduced by an additional minute and the chance to enervate is reduced by an additional 5%.</p>"
