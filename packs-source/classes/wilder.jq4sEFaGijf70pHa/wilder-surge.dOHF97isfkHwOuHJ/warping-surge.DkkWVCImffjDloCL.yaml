  description:
    value: "<p><strong>Wild Surge and Psychic Enervation:</strong> A warping wilder channels her emotions into an aura of energy that shifts the flow of psionics around her. When the warping wilder suffers psychic enervation, she is\_sickened\_for one round per point of wild surge. She also loses power points equal to her normal manifester level (the increase in manifester level from her wild surge does not increase the number of power points lost).</p><p><strong>Surge Bond:</strong> After a warping wilder has invoked a wild surge, all creatures within a 5 ft. radius are affected by a warping effect. Allies of the warping wilder can choose to treat their manifester level as one higher for all powers manifested while in the warped area. This does not supply any additional power points to augment the power, but does allow the manifester to spend more power points if he so chooses. All enemies of the warping wilder treat their manifester level as one lower for all powers manifested while in the warped area. If this would reduce the manifester level lower than that required to manifest the power, the effect fails and the enemy wastes the action used, but no power points are spent. Spellcasters are affected in a similar fashion. All affected creatures, both allies who choose the manifester level boost and all enemies, suffer a 30% risk of psychic enervation when manifesting powers or casting spells and suffer the same psychic enervation effects as the warping wilder would. This warping effect lasts for one round per point of the wild surge that invoked the warping effect and does not stack with effects such as Overchannel or wild surge.</p><p><strong>Improved Surge Bond:</strong> At 5th level, the radius of the warping effect increases by 5 ft. and the increase in manifester level for allies and the penalty to manifester level for enemies increases by 1. Every four levels thereafter (9th, 13th, and 17th), the radius extends by an additional 5 ft. and the bonus and penalty improve by 1.</p>"
