  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a move action, a soulknife of 3rd level or higher can imbue her mind
      blade with destructive psychic energy. This effect deals an extra 1d8
      points of damage on any attack she wishes to activate it on (as long as
      the attack is made with her mind blade). A soulknife may hold the charge
      as long as she likes without discharging.  It does not go off on any
      attack unless she chooses to use it, and the charge is not wasted if an
      attack misses. Mindless creatures are immune to this damage, although
      non-mindless creatures immune to mind-affecting effects are affected by
      this damage as normal. (Unlike the rogue's sneak attack, the psychic
      strike is not precision damage and can affect creatures otherwise immune
      to extra damage from critical hits or more than 30 feet away.)

      </p><p>A mind blade deals this extra damage only once when this ability is
      called upon, but a soulknife can imbue her mind blade with psychic energy
      again by taking another move action. Additionally, she may recharge it as
      a swift action by expending her psionic focus.

      </p><p>Once a soulknife has prepared her blade for a psychic strike, it
      holds the extra energy until it is used (whether the attack is successful
      or not). Even if the soulknife drops the mind blade (or it otherwise
      dissipates, such as when it is thrown), it is still imbued with psychic
      energy when the soulknife next materializes it.

      </p><p>If the soulknife forms her mind blade into two weapons, she may
      imbue each mind blade with psychic strike as normal. If she reshapes her
      mind blade into a single weapon form, the additional psychic strike imbued
      into the additional weapon is lost.

      </p><p>At every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, etc), the extra damage
      from a soulknife's psychic strike increases by 1d8.
