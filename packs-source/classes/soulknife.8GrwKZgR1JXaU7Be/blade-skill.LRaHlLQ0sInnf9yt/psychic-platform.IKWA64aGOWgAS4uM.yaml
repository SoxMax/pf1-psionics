  description:
    value: <p>The soulknife produces a disk of solid, barely luminous force beneath her feet on which to stand. As an immediate action, the soulknife expends her psionic focus to generate this psychic construct which acts as a 5-foot circle of force that exists for a number of rounds equal to her Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1) or until the soulknife is no longer standing on it. This platform is either stationary and may float in mid-air or in liquid, or it is subject to gravity as normal (the soulknife chooses upon manifesting the platform) and has a hardness of 5 and 10 hit points. This platform can be elastic (allowing for the soulknife to be treated as if she had a running start for checks made to jump), slick (to allow for sliding down surfaces such as hills or staircases), and/or ‘sticky', where the soulknife may stick to it at an otherwise impossible angles (such as upside down or at 90 degree or more angles) at her will. Many uses of this platform are subject to GM decision (Acrobatics checks for jumping or balancing, for example). Actions related to the use of this platform gain a competence bonus on checks equal to the soulknife's enhancement bonus on her mind blade. The soulknife must be at least 6th level and possess the Telekinetic Athletics blade skill in order to select this blade skill.</p>
