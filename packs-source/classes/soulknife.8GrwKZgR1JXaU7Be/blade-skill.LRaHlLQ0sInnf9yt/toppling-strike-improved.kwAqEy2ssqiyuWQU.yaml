  description:
    value: >-
      <p>If the soulknife's mind blade has the Trip special feature, she may use
      it to make a single attack at her full base attack bonus as a standard
      action. If the attack hits, it deals damage normally and the soulknife can
      make a free trip attack (using her full base attack bonus) against the
      same foe. If she successfully trips that foe, she may make an additional
      trip attack (using her full base attack bonus) against another foe within
      reach and adjacent to the first foe. As long as she successfully trips her
      foe, she may continue to make trip attempts against foes adjacent to the
      previous foe, so long as they are within her reach. She does not provoke
      attacks of opportunity for these trip attempts. A soulknife must have the
      Toppling Strike and Weapon Special blade skills before selecting this
      blade skill.</p>
