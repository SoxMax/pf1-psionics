  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The soulknife has learned a potent trick that some call the ‘ghost
      step'; a teleportation-based principle that allows the soulknife to slip
      between nearby places at great speed. As a move action, the soulknife can
      expend her psionic focus to teleport to any location she can see within
      close range (25 feet + 5 feet per 2 soulknife levels). She can carry no
      more than 50 lbs. of additional gear, and cannot bring creatures other
      than her psicrystal (if she has one) with her. The use of this ability
      ends the soulknife's turn. At 10th level, the this ability can be used to
      teleport up to medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per soulknife level), and
      she may teleport as a swift action instead of a move action. This is a
      teleportation effect. This blade skill meets the prerequisites for and
      functions with Dimensional Agility and feats that require it as a
      prerequisite. The soulknife must be at least 4th level in order to select
      this blade skill.</p>
