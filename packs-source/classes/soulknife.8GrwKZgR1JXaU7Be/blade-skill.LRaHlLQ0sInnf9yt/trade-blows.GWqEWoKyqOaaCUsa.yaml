  description:
    value: >-
      <p>When the soulknife uses the total defense action, she may make a melee
      attack at her normal attack bonus on anyone that makes a melee attack
      against her, regardless of whether the opponent's attack hits. This attack
      is resolved immediately after the opponent's attack. The soulknife may
      make one such attack for each attack made against her. If multiple
      opponents attack the soulknife, each attack she makes must be against the
      enemy that triggered it. All such attacks are made with a -4 penalty on
      the attack roll, and are an exception to the rule that you cannot attack
      during the total defense action. A soulknife must be at least 10th level
      to choose this blade skill.</p>
