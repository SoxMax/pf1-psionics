  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The soulknife may form mind armor as if she possessed the mind
      armaments class feature (see armored blade soulknife archetype); this only
      allows her to form mind armor from the mind armaments class feature
      (weapons must be formed from another ability). She may form the mind armor
      as a move action and remains until it is dismissed (free action) or until
      she is knocked unconscious or dead. She uses the mind armaments
      enhancement bonus from the armored blade archetype to determine the mind
      armor's enhancement bonus based on her soulknife level and may select
      armor special abilities from that archetype. As usual, whenever the
      soulknife forms multiple items, the enhancement bonus of all items she
      forms decrease by 1 per item formed after the first. She may also shape
      the form of her mind armor as if she possessed the shape mind armaments
      class feature (mind armor only). Unlike the mind armaments class feature
      of the armored blade, psychokinetic armor is not subject to the benefits
      of the Improved Enhancement blade skill. This functions otherwise in all
      ways as the mind armaments class feature for the purposes of prerequisites
      and requirements. The soulknife must be 4th level to select this blade
      skill.</p>
