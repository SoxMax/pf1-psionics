    value: >-
      <p>At 20th level, a soulknife reaches the pinnacle of her art and her
      connection to her blade is so strong it cannot be severed. She no longer
      requires a Will save to maintain her mind blade in a {{lcil|Null Psionics
      Field<i>, although it still loses any enhancement bonus and special
      abilities. In addition, she may change the configurations of her mind
      blade's special abilities at will as a full-round action, which also
      resets any penalties that may have accrued from the Fluid Form and
      Improved Fluid Form blade skills.</i>
