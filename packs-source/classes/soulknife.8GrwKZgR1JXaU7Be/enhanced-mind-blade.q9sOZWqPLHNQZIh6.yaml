  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A soulknife's mind blade improves as the character gains higher levels.
      At 3rd level and every odd level thereafter, the mind blade gains a
      cumulative +1 enhancement bonus that she may spend on an actual
      enhancement bonus or on weapon special abilities. A soulknife's level
      determines her maximum enhancement bonus (see Table 2-8: The Soulknife).
      The soulknife may (and must, when her total enhancement is higher than her
      maximum bonus) apply any special ability from the table below instead of
      an enhancement bonus, as long as she meets the level requirements. A
      soulknife can choose any combination of weapon special abilities and/or
      enhancement bonus that does not exceed the total allowed by the
      soulknife's level, but she must assign at least a +1 enhancement bonus
      before assigning any special abilities.

      </p><p>If the soulknife shapes her mind blade into two items, the
      enhancement bonus of her mind blade (if any) is reduced by 1 (to a minimum
      of 0). If this would reduce the enhancement bonus on the mind blades to 0
      and weapon special abilities are applied, the soulknife must reshape her
      mind blade to make the options valid. Both mind blades have the same
      selection of enhancement bonus and weapon special abilities (if any). This
      penalty does not apply when using the Mind Shield blade skill.
