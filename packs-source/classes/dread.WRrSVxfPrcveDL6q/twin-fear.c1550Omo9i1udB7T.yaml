  description:
    value: >-
      <p>When a dread of at least 11th level has a shadow twin active, if any
      creature within 30 ft. of the dread or the shadow twin suffers from the
      shaken, frightened, or panicked condition at the start of the dread's
      turn, the shadow twin uses a separate action pool instead of sharing the
      round's actions with the dread for that round. This means that it and the
      dread could both make attacks in the same round.

      </p><p>At 15th level, if any creature within 30 ft. of the dread or shadow
      twin suffers from the frightened or panicked condition, the shadow twin is
      treated as if under the affect of the <a href="/wiki/Form_of_Doom"
      class="mw-redirect" title="Form of Doom">form of doom</a> power. Unlike
      other effects, the dread is not also under this effect.

      </p>
