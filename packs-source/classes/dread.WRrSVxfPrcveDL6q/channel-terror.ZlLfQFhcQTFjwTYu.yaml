  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 3rd level, the dread learns how to channel her terrors through any
      melee weapon she is holding or through her devastating touch class
      feature, even if using devastating touch as a ranged attack (such as
      through the mindlock terror). If channeling a terror through a weapon, it
      does not gain the benefits of the devastating touch ability.
