  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A dread is able to channel psionic energy from fear and nightmares into
      a touch that causes pain. To use this ability, a dread must make a melee
      touch attack as a standard action on a living target. If the attack hits,
      it deals 1d6 points of damage plus 1 point per class level. The dread does
      not add his Strength modifier to the damage of this attack.
