  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 1st level, a psychic warrior gets a bonus combat-oriented feat in
      addition to the feat that any 1st level character gets and the bonus feat
      granted to a human character. The psychic warrior gains an additional
      bonus feat at 2nd level and every three levels thereafter (5th, 8th,
      etc.). These bonus feats must be drawn from the feats noted as combat
      feats or psionic feats. The psychic warrior must still meet all
      prerequisites for the bonus feat, including ability score and base attack
      bonus minimums as well as class requirements (like levels in another
      specific class).

      </p><p>These bonus feats are in addition to the feats that a character of
      any class gains every two levels. A psychic warrior is not limited to
      combat feats and psionic feats when choosing these other feats.
