  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 4th level, the psychic warrior gains a +2 bonus to one skill
      associated with a path he is on. Every three levels thereafter, he can
      choose to increase the bonus to one of his path skills by +2 (to a maximum
      of +6 for any one path skill). This may be a skill he has already chosen
      or a new skill associated with a path he is on.
