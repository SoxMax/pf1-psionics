  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 20th level, once per day as a free action, the psychic warrior can
      enter into a very powerful trance. As long as he maintains psionic focus,
      for up to 5 minutes the psychic warrior adds his Wisdom modifier to his
      attack rolls, damage rolls, AC, skill checks, ability checks, saves, and
      initiative, and he increases his speed by +5 feet for every point of his
      Wisdom modifier. These benefits stack with those that might be granted by
      his active path's trance (or both paths, if using pathweaving).
