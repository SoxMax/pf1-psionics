      - Psychic Warrior
  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 9th level, the psychic warrior gets to choose a second warrior's
      path. He chooses one of the path powers available from his new list. The
      psychic warrior may only have two path powers in total from a single given
      path.

      </p><p>At 11th level, the psychic warrior can choose to use the trance and
      maneuver from his second warrior's path, but may only benefit from one
      trance at a time. The psychic warrior treats the path skills of his
      secondary path as class skills and may select them when choosing a path
      skill.
