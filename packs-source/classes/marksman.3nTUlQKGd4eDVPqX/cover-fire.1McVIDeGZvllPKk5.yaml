  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Beginning at 4th level, the Marksman knows not only how to directly
      engage her enemies, but also how to protect her allies. As an attack
      action, she may choose to fire a ranged or thrown weapon at an opponent
      within 30 feet to distract that opponent rather than to deal damage. Make
      an attack roll against the space a target occupies (AC 10). If successful,
      the targeted enemy must make a Reflex save (DC 10 + one-half the
      Marksman's class level + the Marksman's Dexterity modifier), or be
      staggered for one round. The Marksman still expends ammunition as normal
      for this attack.

      </p><p>If the attack roll would indicate a critical threat and the result
      would hit the opponent's AC, roll to confirm: if the critical hit is
      confirmed against the opponent's AC, the attack does normal damage as
      well. A Marksman cannot use cover fire if her opponent or the square she
      targets would be subject to a miss chance (such as from a concealed
      target).
