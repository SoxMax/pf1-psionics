  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A Marksman can use her heightened senses and awareness of her
      surroundings to read the wind and environment, allowing her to drastically
      improve her accuracy. While maintaining psionic focus, she can spend a
      swift action to gain a competence bonus equal to her Wisdom modifier on
      ranged attacks until the end of the round. She can do this a number of
      times per day equal to 3 + her class level.
