  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 2nd level, a Marksman's familiarity with ranged attacks and her
      natural intuition alerts her to danger from mundane ranged attacks. She
      gains a +1 Dodge bonus to Armor Class against ranged attacks (but not
      ranged touch attacks). At 6th level and every four Marksman levels
      thereafter, this Dodge bonus increases by 1.
