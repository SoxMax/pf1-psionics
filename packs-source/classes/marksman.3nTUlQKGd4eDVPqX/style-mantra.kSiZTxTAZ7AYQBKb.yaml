  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 3rd level, a Marksman gains a mantra associated with her combat
      style that is active as long as she maintains psionic focus. A Marksman
      may not use her style mantra at the same time she uses Wind Reader; she
      may only gain the benefit of one or the other, not both.
