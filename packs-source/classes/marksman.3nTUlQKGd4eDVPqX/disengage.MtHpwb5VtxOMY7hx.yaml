  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Once a Marksman has reached 7th level, she learns how to effectively
      distance herself from enemies. When the Marksman would provoke an attack
      of opportunity for moving out of a threatened space, she may expend her
      psionic focus to add her Wisdom modifier to her Acrobatics rolls to avoid
      attacks of opportunity for the round and can move at full speed without
      increasing the Acrobatics DC.
