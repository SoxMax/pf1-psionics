  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A vitalist learns to use psionic power to connect willing minds through
      an internal network that strengthens their psychic bonds. As a standard
      action, a vitalist can join a number willing targets into his collective
      equal to his key ability modifier or half his vitalist level, whichever is
      higher. The vitalist must have line of sight to each target, each target
      must have a Wisdom score of at least 1, and all targets must be within
      Medium range (100 ft. + 10 ft. per class level). The vitalist is always
      considered a member of his own collective, and does not count against this
      limit.</p><p>The vitalist can choose to remove a member as a free action
      on his turn, and any member can voluntarily leave the collective as a free
      action on their turn. Any member whose Wisdom drops to zero or who moves
      out of range of the collective is automatically removed. If a member
      enters a null psionics field, the connection to the collective is
      suppressed until that member leaves the field. A member who leaves the
      collective for any reason immediately loses any and all benefits they may
      have gained from being a member. A vitalist is aware of the status of his
      collective and can, roughly, sense the presence of each member, although
      beyond telling if such a creature is still a member, this has no
      mechanical benefit until higher levels (see telepathy and health sense,
      below).</p><p>A vitalist can manifest certain powers through his
      collective. If a vitalist power specifies one or more willing targets (or
      is harmless) and has a range greater than personal, he can manifest this
      power on a member of his collective regardless of the range of the actual
      power. All other non-range restrictions still apply. He may also manifest
      any power with the Network descriptor this way, regardless of their actual
      ranges or targets. If he is capable of manifesting powers or casting
      spells from a different class (as is the case for a multiclass vitalist),
      any compatible spell or power with a range greater than touch can also be
      used through the collective.</p><p>If a member of the collective dies, the
      member is removed from the collective and the vitalist must make a
      Fortitude save (DC 15) or lose 1 power point for every Hit Die of the
      fallen member and be sickened for an equal number of rounds.</p><ul><li>At
      15th level, a vitalist's collective range is limitless on the same plane
      as the vitalist.</li><li>At 19th level, a vitalist's collective reaches
      even across to other planes and dimensions.</li></ul>
