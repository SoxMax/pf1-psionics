  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A vitalist of 2nd level gains special abilities when manifesting powers
      with the Network descriptor. He can manifest these powers on any member of
      his collective, even if they are out of the power's range or would
      normally be immune to the power. Whenever a vitalist manifests a power
      with the Network descriptor targeting only members of his collective, the
      power loses the mind-affecting descriptor (if it had it) and bypasses any
      power resistance, although it still provokes an attack of opportunity to
      manifest as normal. Network powers manifest only on members of the
      collective never allow saving throws — their saving throw entry becomes
      “None,” although if the power specifies a subsequent saving throw,
      subjects attempt those saves normally. The vitalist also adds the
      following augment to all powers with the Network
      descriptor:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every additional
      power point you spend, you can choose an additional target, so long as the
      target is a member of your collective.</p></li></ul>
