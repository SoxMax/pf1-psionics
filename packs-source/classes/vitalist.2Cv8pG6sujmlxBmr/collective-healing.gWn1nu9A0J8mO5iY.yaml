  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Whenever a willing member of the vitalist's collective could regain
      lost hit points or ability damage, the vitalist may choose to redirect any
      or all of that healing to one or more other willing members of the
      collective as a free action. This can transfer instantaneous healing (such
      as a body adjustment power), healing from ongoing healing effects, such as
      fast healing, and even hit points gained from rest (in which case, a
      member of the collective would rest for a period of time as normal, and
      the amount of hit points and ability damage healed would go to
      another).</p><p>In any case, the original recipient of the healing effect
      chooses whether to allow the diverted healing, and does not gain the
      benefits of any healing he grants to another. The type of healing
      (positive energy, negative energy, construct repair, etc.) is unchanged
      from the original source for determining who or what can be
      healed.</p><p><em>Example</em>: Darius the soulknife is a willing member
      of Jorus the vitalist's collective. He drinks a potion of cure light
      wounds that would normally heal him for 6 hit points, but Jorus decides to
      redirect 4 of those points to himself. Darius agrees and, as a result,
      Darius is healed for 2 hit points, and Jorus is healed for 4. If there
      were more members in Jorus's collective, Jorus could spread the healing
      from that potion out even more as long as the sum of hit points healed was
      no greater than 6.</p><p>A vitalist may even heal wounds through
      collective healing if at full health. This may only be used with healing
      effects such as potions, powers, or other such effects. [Healing] from
      long term care or natural healing cannot be transferred in this way.</p>
