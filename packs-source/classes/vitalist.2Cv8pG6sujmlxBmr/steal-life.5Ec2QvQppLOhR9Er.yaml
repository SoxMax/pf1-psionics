  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Beginning at 14th level, a vitalist can not only steal the health of a
      target, but steal their life itself. By making a successful melee touch
      attack and expending psionic focus, the vitalist can force the target to
      make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + half class level + Wisdom modifier) or die.
      A successful save negates this effect. Targets with more than 140 hit
      points are unaffected by this ability.

      </p><p>If the target fails the save, the vitalist is able to channel the
      stolen life force through his collective, healing any number of the
      members of his collective for a combined total of 5 hit points per hit die
      the original target had.

      </p><p>This ability may only be used on creatures with a Constitution
      score and may not be used against creatures in the vitalist's collective.

      </p><p>For example, Jorus is a level 14 vitalist and he uses steal life on
      a thought slayer, which has 11 hit dice. The thought slayer fails the
      Fortitude save, so Jorus can heal up to 55 hit points over his collective,
      divided among the members as he sees fit.

      </p><p>A vitalist must wait 10 minutes after using this ability before he
      can attempt to use it again. This is considered a death effect.

      </p>
