      <p><em>A soulthief vitalist develops techniques that focus on harnessing
      the energy of enemies, siphoning it off and using it to heal himself and
      his allies.</em></p><p><strong>Soulthief Power:</strong> A soulthief
      vitalist adds
      <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf1-psionics.powers.Item.XjFBnYGwGhBF8Prs]{Collapse}</em>
      to his list of powers known. This does not count against his number of
      powers known.</p><p><strong>Soulthief Knacks:</strong> A soulthief can
      select one of the talents below as his method
      knack.</p><ul><li><p><em>@UUID[Compendium.pf1-psionics.powers.Item.vecZ9Bfr59u9Wu86]{Fatigue}</em>:
      Cause a creature to be
      fatigued.</p></li><li><p><em>@UUID[Compendium.pf1-psionics.powers.Item.lkTPtnYxbzQtO3vb]{Siphon}</em>:
      Deal 1d3 points of damage and gain 1 temporary hit
      point.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Soulthief's Touch:</strong> A soulthief
      vitalist of 2nd level who utilizes transfer wounds can choose to instead
      deal the amount of damage that transfer wounds would normally heal plus
      the soulthief's class level to the target, healing himself a number of hit
      points equal to the damage dealt. A soulthief may not heal more hit points
      than the touched creature had prior to using this ability.</p><p>This
      ability may only be used on creatures with a Constitution score and may
      not be used against creatures in the soulthief's collective. A soulthief
      may use this ability on creatures with a total number of hit dice less
      than half his vitalist level, but he gains no healing from
      it.</p><p><strong>Soulthief's Pulse:</strong> As a free action, a
      soulthief of 6th level may project a pulse to all members of his
      collective by spending one power point, which empowers the attacks of the
      members of the collective for one round. Any successful damaging attack
      made with an attack roll made by a member of the collective heals the
      attacker for the damage dealt, up to 2 hit points of damage. Every three
      vitalist levels thereafter, the maximum healing granted by this aura
      increases by 1.</p><p><strong>Swift Aid:</strong> A soulthief of 8th level
      may, as an immediate action and by expending his psionic focus, transfer
      the wounds of a member of his collective to an enemy within 15 ft. of the
      ally for an amount of damage equal to the soulthief's transfer wounds
      ability. A successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 class level + Wisdom
      modifier) negates the effect.</p><p><strong>Soulthief's
      Expertise:</strong> Upon achieving 11th level, anytime a soulthief
      manifests
      <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf1-psionics.powers.Item.DjeCOTwMtfNxMHKq]{Empathic
      Transfer, Hostile}</em>, the attack can be made as a ranged touch attack
      with a range of 30 feet instead of as a melee touch attack. In addition,
      every additional power point spent augmenting hostile empathic transfer
      increases the additional damage transferred by 7, rather than by 5, and
      the maximum number of points of damage transferred increases to
      85.</p><p>In addition, any time a soulthief manifests a power or psi-like
      ability that deals hit point damage, it heals him for 50% of the damage
      dealt. If the power does hit point damage to multiple targets, the
      soulthief only heals 50% of the damage to the target dealt the highest
      damage.</p><p><strong>Master Soulthief:</strong> A soulthief of 20th level
      learns how to siphon the life out of a creature. Once every 10 minutes,
      the soulthief can choose one target to which he has line of sight and, as
      a full-round action and by expending his psionic focus, begin draining the
      target of health (12d6 points of empathic damage) which is then
      transferred to the collective and heals an equal amount of damage. A
      successful Will save (DC 20 + Wis modifier) negates the effect. Each
      round, the target may attempt another Will save to negate the effect. The
      soulthief can maintain concentration to continue the damage each round,
      for up to one minute. Any damage done after all members of the collective
      are healed completely instead grants temporary hit points to any member of
      the collective (soulthief's choice) for 10 minutes. The soulthief may
      divide these temporary hit points as he so chooses among members of the
      collective.</p>
