      <p><span class="va-quotation-text"><em>An intercessor tries to find a
      solution to every problem through communication. The intercessor likely
      finds a peaceful solution instead of preventing, healing, or dealing
      harm.</em></span></p><p><strong>Intercessor Power:</strong> An intercessor
      vitalist adds
      <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf1-psionics.powers.Item.a36rIe5mlkREIaFR]{Telempathic
      Projection}</em> to his list of powers known. This does not count against
      his number of powers known.</p><p><strong>Intercessor Knacks:</strong> An
      intercessor gains the talent below as his method
      knack.</p><ul><li><em>@UUID[Compendium.pf1-psionics.powers.Item.B3mTkwSo1FkG9Lw0]{Empathy}</em>:
      You know the subject's surface emotions.</li></ul><p><strong>Intercessor's
      Touch:</strong> An intercessor vitalist of 2nd level who utilizes transfer
      wounds shares an empathic bond with the healed target. The intercessor
      gains an insight bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Sense Motive
      checks equal to his class level for all checks with that
      target.</p><p>This effect lasts for a number of minutes equal to the
      vitalist's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). The vitalist may only have one
      such empathic bond active at any time, should he use transfer wounds on
      another target while he has an active empathic bond, the first bond
      immediately ends and he establishes an empathic bond with the new
      target.</p><p><strong>Intercessor's Pulse:</strong> As a free action, an
      intercessor of 6th level may project a pulse to all members of his
      collective by spending one power point, granting them one of the effects
      below at the intercessor's choice. The effect lasts for one
      round.</p><dl><dd><p><em>Inspire Courage:</em> The vitalist inspires
      courage in the members of his collective (including himself), bolstering
      them against fear and improving their combat abilities. To be affected, an
      ally must be in the vitalist's collective. An affected ally receives a +2
      morale bonus on saving throws against charm and fear effects and a +2
      competence bonus on attack and weapon damage rolls. At 12th level and 18th
      level, this bonus increases by +1, to a maximum of +4 at 18th level.
      Inspire courage is a mind-affecting
      ability.</p></dd></dl><dl><dd><p><em>Inspire Competence:</em> All members
      of the collective get a +2 competence bonus on skill checks with a
      particular skill as long as they stay in the collective. This bonus
      increases by +1 for every four levels the vitalist has attained beyond 6th
      (+3 at 10th, +4 at 14th, and +5 at 18th). Unlike the bardic performance of
      the same name, skills such as Stealth can be used. The vitalist can't
      inspire competence in himself.</p></dd></dl><dl><dd><p><em>Sanctuary:</em>
      All members of the collective are treated as if under the effects of the
      <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf1.spells.Item.yk5bgi6j9kbtigof]{Sanctuary}</em>
      spell for one round, with a caster level equal to the vitalist's
      manifester level. If a member of the collective performs an action that
      would break the effect, it breaks the effect only for that member of the
      collective.</p></dd></dl><p><strong>Swift Aid:</strong> If a member of his
      collective fails a Will saving throw, an intercessor of 8th level may, as
      an immediate action and by expending his psionic focus, make an additional
      Will saving throw for the member of his collective. The intercessor gains
      a +1 insight bonus to this save. This insight bonus increases by +1 every
      four vitalist levels thereafter.</p><p>If the intercessor fails the saving
      throw, his ally suffers the consequences of the effect that forced the
      Will save.</p><p><strong>Intercessor's Expertise:</strong> Upon reaching
      11th level, the intercessor gains a +2 bonus to the save DC of any
      mind-affecting power that he manifests. This bonus stacks with any other
      bonus to the save DCs from his powers, including those from augmentation
      or feats such as Psionic Endowment.</p><p>In addition, the intercessor can
      now read and speak any language.</p><p><strong>Master
      Intercessor:</strong> The intercessor of 20th level has learned to emit a
      telepathic aura that causes enemies to prefer to attack one member of the
      collective over the others should a peaceful solution not be possible. The
      intercessor chooses one member of the collective as the preferred target
      as a swift action with a duration of one minute. Changing the preferred
      target is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. At the
      start of the enemy's turn, it feels a mental inclination to avoid
      attacking all but one of the collective members. Any time an enemy makes
      an attack against any member of the collective other than the preferred
      target, they suffer a penalty to their attack and damage rolls and to
      rolls to breach power resistance equal to the intercessor's Wisdom
      modifier (minimum 1) and a penalty to the save DCs of effects that do not
      target the preferred target equal to half the intercessor's Wisdom
      modifier (minimum 1) and feel a mental inclination to instead attack the
      preferred target. Effects that target an area that include the preferred
      target are not subject to this penalty, even if other members of the
      collective are in the affected area.</p><p>A member of the intercessor's
      collective may request to become the preferred target as a move action, at
      which time the intercessor may expend his psionic focus as an immediate
      action to allow the change in preferred targets.</p><p>If the enemy cannot
      see the preferred target, the enemy does not suffer the effects of this
      ability. Should the preferred target be reduced to 0 or fewer hit points,
      this effect immediately ends.</p><p>This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>
