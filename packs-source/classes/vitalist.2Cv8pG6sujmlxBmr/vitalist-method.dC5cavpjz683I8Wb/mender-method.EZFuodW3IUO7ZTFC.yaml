      <p><span class="va-quotation-text"><em>A mender vitalist is the most
      common found, as he focuses on healing wounds more efficiently, even
      bringing back life to the dead. The mender vitalist learns how to boost
      the body's natural healing ability to unimaginable regenerative
      levels.</em></span></p><p><strong>Mender Power:</strong> A mender vitalist
      adds
      <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf1-psionics.powers.Item.Cnx8bMkrtofPQDRJ]{Natural
      Healing}</em> to his list of powers known. This does not count against his
      number of powers known.</p><p><strong>Mender Knacks:</strong> A mender
      gains the talent below as his method
      knack.</p><ul><li><em>@UUID[Compendium.pf1-psionics.powers.Item.1eq5n08zT8gK9tni]{Halt
      Death}</em>: Automatically stabilize a dying
      creature.</li></ul><p><strong>Mender's Touch:</strong> A mender vitalist
      of 2nd level who utilizes transfer wounds heals the target an additional
      number of hit points equal to his class level. This additional healing is
      not transferred to the mender like the normal amount
      healed.</p><p><strong>Mender's Pulse:</strong> As a free action, a mender
      of 6th level may project a pulse to all members of his collective by
      spending one power point, granting fast healing 1 for one round. Every
      three vitalist levels thereafter, this fast healing increases by 1. This
      healing is not eligible to be redirected using collective
      healing.</p><p><strong>Swift Aid:</strong> A mender of 8th level may, as
      an immediate action and by expending his psionic focus, heal a member of
      his collective as if he had used transfer wounds.</p><p><strong>Mender's
      Expertise:</strong> Upon achieving 11th level, a mender is skilled at
      restoring the psyche of the recently deceased and efficiently healing his
      collective members. Any time a mender manifests
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1-psionics.powers.Item.hCEb5OhGt8ph780v]{Psionic
      Revivify}, the maximum number of rounds after the target's death allowed
      increases by his Wisdom modifier (minimum 1) without the need to suffer
      additional negative levels.</p><p>In addition, anytime a mender manifests
      a power with the [Healing] descriptor, it heals an additional 50% hit
      points (round down).</p><p><strong>Master Mender:</strong> A mender of
      20th level is capable of healing even the most grievous of injuries. As a
      full-round action and by expending his psionic focus, the mender can heal
      a member of his collective to full health, including restoring any ability
      drain, removing fatigue or exhaustion, and curing any poisons or diseases.
      The mender can use this ability once every 10 minutes.</p>
