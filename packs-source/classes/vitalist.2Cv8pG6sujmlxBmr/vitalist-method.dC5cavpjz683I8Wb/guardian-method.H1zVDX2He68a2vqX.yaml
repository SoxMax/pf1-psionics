      <p><em>A guardian vitalist focuses his skill on keeping his allies from
      suffering wounds. He develops psionic abilities that deflect, absorb, and
      reflect damage proactively, rather than healing wounds after they are
      suffered.</em></p><p><strong>Guardian Power:</strong> A guardian vitalist
      adds
      <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf1-psionics.powers.Item.2bx0llDpiQ66ShPZ]{Biofeedback}</em>
      to his list of powers known. This does not count against his number of
      powers known.</p><p><strong>Guardian Knacks:</strong> A guardian can
      select one of the talents below as his method
      knack.</p><ul><li><em>@UUID[Compendium.pf1-psionics.powers.Item.aAWnsECsGQd4zYvd]{Fortify,
      Lesser}</em>: Gain a +1 bonus on saving
      throws.</li><li><em>@UUID[Compendium.pf1-psionics.powers.Item.2zGndi6SFDsb62cx]{Toughen}</em>:
      Grant +1 natural armor to collective
      members.</li></ul><p><strong>Guardian's Touch:</strong> A guardian
      vitalist of 2nd level who utilizes transfer wounds grants the target a
      number of temporary hit points equal to his class level. These temporary
      hit points last a number of rounds equal to the vitalist's Wisdom modifier
      (minimum 1) and do not stack with any other temporary hit
      points.</p><p><strong>Guardian's Pulse:</strong> As a free action,
      guardian of 6th level may project a pulse to all members of his collective
      by spending one power point, granting them DR 2/- for one round. Every
      three vitalist levels thereafter, this DR increases by
      1.</p><p><strong>Swift Aid:</strong> A guardian of 8th level may, as an
      immediate action and by expending his psionic focus, grant a member of his
      collective a +1 insight bonus to AC or saves (guardian's choice) that
      lasts until the beginning of the target's next turn. This insight bonus
      increases by +1 every four vitalist levels
      thereafter.</p><p><strong>Guardian's Expertise:</strong> Upon achieving
      11th level, anytime a guardian manifests
      <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf1-psionics.powers.Item.zylCrNW8B3cHQJ86]{Empathic
      Feedback}</em>, the power gains two additional augment
      options.</p><ul><li>If you spend 6 additional power points, this power may
      be manifested as an immediate action.</li><li>If you spend 4 additional
      power points, the damage dealt to the attacker is subtracted from the
      damage you take.</li></ul><p>In addition, any time a guardian manifests a
      power on a member of his collective (including himself) with a range of
      You and a duration measured in rounds, the guardian may expend his psionic
      focus to treat that power as if affected by the Extend Power
      feat.</p><p><strong>Master Guardian:</strong> A guardian of 20th level
      can, as a full-round action and by expending his psionic focus, give one
      member of the collective a psionic bubble of protection. This protective
      bubble grants DR 6/-, PR 27, resistance 20 against any attack that deals
      acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage, and a +6 deflection bonus
      to AC. This protective bubble lasts for one minute. The guardian can use
      this ability once every 10 minutes.</p>
