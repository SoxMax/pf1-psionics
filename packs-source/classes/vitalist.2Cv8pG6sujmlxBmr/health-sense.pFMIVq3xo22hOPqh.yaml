  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Beginning at 2nd level, a vitalist may take a swift action to gauge the
      relative health level of collective members, determining the amount of
      damage, in hit points, that an ally has taken. In addition, the vitalist
      may make a Heal check as a standard action, with a DC of 15, to determine
      if any of the members of his collective are afflicted by a disease or
      poison.

      </p><p>Starting at 7th level, the vitalist can make a Heal check over his
      collective to stabilize a dying target or treat a wound from a caltrop,
      spike growth, spike stones, or similar. This ability improves at 12th
      level, and the vitalist may make a Heal check over his collective to treat
      a poisoned creature.

      </p><p>At 17th level, the vitalist is able to treat diseases in the same
      fashion, making a Heal check over his collective.

      </p><p>When treating a target over a collective, the DC of the Heal check
      is the same as if the vitalist was treating the target normally.
