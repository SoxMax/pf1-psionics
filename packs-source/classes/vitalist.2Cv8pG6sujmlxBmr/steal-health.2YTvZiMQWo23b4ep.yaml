  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 3rd level, a vitalist has learned to siphon the health of a creature
      and use it for his own needs or the needs of his collective. As a touch
      attack, the vitalist may deal a number of hit points in damage to the
      target equal to his vitalist level + his Wisdom modifier and heal an equal
      amount of damage. The vitalist may share any healing from this effect over
      his collective, even if he himself would not be eligible for the healing.
      A vitalist may not heal more hit points than the touched creature had
      prior to using this ability.

      </p><p>This ability may only be used on creatures with a Constitution
      score and may not be used against creatures in the vitalist's collective.
      A vitalist may use this ability on creatures with a total number of hit
      dice less than half his vitalist level, but he gains no healing from it.

      </p><p>For example, Jorus is a level 3 vitalist with a Wisdom of 16 and 15
      hit points. Jorus has suffered 3 hit points of damage and uses Steal
      Health on a nearby 2 hit dice orc, dealing 6 hit points of damage (3 from
      his levels in vitalist, 3 from his Wisdom modifier). Although Jorus may
      only heal himself for 3 hit points, he may distribute the other 3 hit
      points over the collective to other members as needed. If Jorus was level
      6, he would have dealt 9 points of damage, but would not have received any
      healing because the orc's total number of hit dice was too low.

      </p><p>At 7th level, a vitalist is able to use steal health as a ranged
      touch attack with a range of 30 feet.
