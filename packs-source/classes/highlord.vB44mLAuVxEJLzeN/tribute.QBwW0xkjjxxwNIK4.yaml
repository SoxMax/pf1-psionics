  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 5th level, a highlord can draw upon the talents of his collective
      and use them as his own. As a move action, the highlord designates a
      single feat, item enhancement, power effect, or spell effect from among
      those belonging or affecting willing members of his collective as tribute.
      The highlord gains the effects of the selected tribute until he designates
      a new tribute, for as long as the effect remains active on the member that
      possessed. In addition, if a member of the collective leaves the
      collective, the highlord loses the effects of tributes from that member.

      </p><p>When he gains this ability, the highlord may only have one tribute
      designated at once. At 11th level, the highlord may have up to two
      tributes designated, and at 17th level, he may have up to three. Once the
      highlord gains the ability to have multiple tributes at once, he may
      choose his tributes from either the same or different members of the
      collective, and can choose a different type of effect for each tribute.

      </p><p>If the highlord selects a feat as one of his designated tributes,
      he must meet the prerequisites of that feat. He may use feats gained
      through other designated tributes to meet these prerequisites. If the
      highlord selects an item enhancement, he applies that item enhancement to
      a single qualifying item (such as a ranged weapon gaining the <i>distant
      </i>enhancement) that he is carrying or wielding. The normal caps on an
      item's enhancement bonus and special properties still apply. The item
      loses the designated property if the highlord ceases to carry and/or use
      it.
