    value: >-
      <p>At 10th level, and every three levels thereafter, a highlord can choose
      one of the following greater decrees in place of a decree. Some greater
      decrees require the expenditure of power points in order to be used. The
      highlord cannot spend more power points on a single decree at once than
      his manifester level. Unless stated otherwise, greater decrees are treated
      as decrees for the purposes of abilities and feats such as Ability Focus.
