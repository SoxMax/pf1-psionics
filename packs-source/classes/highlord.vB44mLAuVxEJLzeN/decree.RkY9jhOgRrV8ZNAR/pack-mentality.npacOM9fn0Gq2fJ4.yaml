  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The highlord can enhance his collective’s skill at working together to
      take down their enemies. Activating this decree is a free action, and it
      lasts for a number of rounds equal to the highlord’s Charisma modifier
      (minimum 1 round). If two or more allies within the highlord’s collective
      are threatening the same opponent, they can be treated as flanking that
      opponent. The collective can gain this benefit against multiple opponents
      at the same time. When an allied collective member (including the
      highlord) successfully uses the aid another action on another allied
      collective member, the bonus granted is increased by +1. If multiple
      allies aid the same creature, this increase is only added once. At 7th
      level and every six highlord levels thereafter, the bonuses increase by a
      further +1, to a maximum increase of +3 at 19th level. This decree is not
      a mind-affecting effect </p>
