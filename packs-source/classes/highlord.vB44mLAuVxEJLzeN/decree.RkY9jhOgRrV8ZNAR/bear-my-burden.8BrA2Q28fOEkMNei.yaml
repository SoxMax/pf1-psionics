  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Whenever the highlord suffers from any of the following conditions, he
      may activate this decree as an immediate action, even if the condition
      would prevent him from taking an immediate action.</p><p>Bleed, Blinded,
      Confused, Cowering, Dazed, Dazzled, Deafened, Energy Drained, Exhausted,
      Fascinated, Fatigued, Frightened, Nauseated, Panicked, Paralyzed,
      Petrified, Shaken, Sickened, Staggered, Stunned</p><p>The highlord
      designates another member of the collective who has at least half the Hit
      Dice of the highlord and is not immune to the condition. This member of
      the collective begins to suffer the effects of the condition instead of
      the highlord. If the member of the collective succeeds at resisting the
      decree, the highlord suffers the condition as normal.</p><p>However, if
      they accept the exchange or fail to resist it, the highlord is no longer
      affected by the condition and the member of the collective suffers it in
      the highlord’s place for its remaining duration. The duration of the
      decree is identical to the duration of the condition. If they leave the
      collective or the highlord ends this decree, they are freed from the
      condition, and the highlord suffers the condition for the remainder of its
      duration. A highlord must be 7th level or higher to choose this
      decree.</p>
