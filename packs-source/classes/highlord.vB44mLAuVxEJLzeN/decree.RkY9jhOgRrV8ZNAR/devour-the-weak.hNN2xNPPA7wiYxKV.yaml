  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a standard action, highlord can make a coup de grace attempt against
      a member of the collective. This still provokes attacks of opportunity,
      and must follow the normal rules of a coup de grace, such as being made
      with a melee weapon. If this kills a creature, the highlord heals an
      amount of hit points equal to triple the total Hit Dice of the slain
      target, and gains temporary power points equal to the number of Hit Dice
      the slain target had. These power points last a number of rounds equal to
      the highlord’s Charisma modifier (minimum 1 round) and do not stack with
      each other or other temporary power points. The duration of any power
      manifested with these power points is equal to the remaining time on the
      power points, or that power's original duration, whichever is shorter. A
      highlord must be 7th level or higher to choose this decree, and unlike
      other decrees, it does not last beyond its initial use (and as such,
      cannot be dismissed to refund the highlord’s psionic focus). This decree
      is not a mind-affecting effect. </p>
