  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Activating this decree is an immediate action, and it lasts for a
      number of rounds equal to the highlord’s Charisma modifier (minimum 1
      round). The highlord can activate this decree when a member of the
      collective would deal an amount of damage to a creature that would slay it
      outright. After taking the damage, the creature enters a state of
      suspended animation for one minute. </p><p>While in this state, the
      creature is unaware of its surroundings. Outside forces can damage their
      body, but as long as their head remains attached to their torso and their
      brain remains intact, the physical damage can be healed. A coup de grace
      still forces them to make a Fortitude save or die. Healing can still
      affect them, but the stasis will remain even after they have been healed.
      </p><p>If the creature has negative hit points equal to or exceeding their
      Constitution score when the effect ends, they die. Otherwise, they
      stabilize. This effect can continue even after the highlord ends this
      decree, but he can dismiss this effect as a free action. As long as this
      decree is active, the highlord can continue to use this decree as an
      immediate action, sending defeated creatures into stasis instead of death.
      </p>
