  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As an immediate action, the highlord can cause a successful melee
      attack by a member of his collective to become an insult that must be
      answered. Both the member of the collective and the recipient of the
      attack must make a Will save or be forced into one on one combat with one
      another. If both creatures fail their saves against this decree, the only
      creatures either of them are able to attack or affect with harmful
      abilities are each other. They cannot knowingly attack or affect another
      creature with abilities for the duration of the decree. This decree lasts
      for a number of rounds equal the highlord’s Charisma modifier (minimum 1
      round) or until one of the creatures becomes helpless. </p><p>This decree
      becomes inactive if a creature affected moves out of close range (25 feet
      + 5 feet per 2 class levels) from their opponent. If the highlord
      maintains the decree in spite of this, the decree’s effect resumes if the
      creature re-enters the range of their opponent. A creature under the
      effect of this decree cannot be affected by another use of it (either from
      the highlord or another creature capable of using decrees). </p>
