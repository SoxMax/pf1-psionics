  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Activating this decree is a free action, and it lasts for a number of
      rounds equal to the highlord’s Charisma modifier (minimum 1 round). When
      the highlord activates this decree, he chooses a member of his collective,
      and during this duration, he can give that creature orders as a standard
      action.</p><p>When the highlord gives an order, he specifies a course of
      action (such as “attack your leader!”). Then the affected collective
      member takes a standard or move action to fulfill that order to the best
      of their abilities, even though it isn’t their turn. A creature unwilling
      to follow the highlord’s order can make a Will save to resist the orders
      and forgo actions granted by the highlord, ignoring the order and ending
      the decree on a success. Even if they fail the save against this ability,
      such a creature cannot be forced to use abilities with daily usages during
      this action, such as spells or class abilities such as wild shape. After
      taking an ordered action, the collective member becomes staggered until
      the start of the highlord’s next turn.</p>
