  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 6th level, a highlord can siphon mental energy from the members of
      his collective, drawing on their goals and desires that they and he share.
      Whenever the highlord manifests a power, he may also designate another
      member of his collective to drain energy from. That member of the
      collective takes damage equal to the number of power points used on the
      power and becomes staggered until the highlord's next turn. In addition,
      the highlord regains half the total power points he spent on the power.
      The target can resist the staggering effect and deny the highlord the
      regained power points by succeeding at a Fortitude save (DC 10 + the power
      points that would be refunded + the highlord's Charisma modifier). This
      ability can only be used once per round, even if the highlord manifests
      multiple powers during that round.

      </p><p>In addition, a highlord's tenet grants him a specialized version of
      this ability, as listed in the tenet's description.
