  description:
    value: >-
      <p>When a highlord reaches 3rd level, all willing members of his
      collective (including the highlord himself) can communicate with each
      other telepathically, even if they do not share a common language. Psionic
      creatures who are willing members in a highlord's collective (including
      the highlord himself) may manifest unknown powers known by another willing
      psionic creature in the collective as if they were making physical
      contact.
