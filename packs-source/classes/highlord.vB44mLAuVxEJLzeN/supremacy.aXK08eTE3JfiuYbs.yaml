  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Once per round, when a 20th level highlord would die or be destroyed,
      he may choose to have a member of his collective die or be destroyed in
      his stead. Loss of hit points and death effects simply fail to kill him,
      he suffers no change in Constitution score, and he ignores ongoing damage
      for a round. The highlord is healed for an amount equal to the current hit
      points of the member who died for him. If this amount of hit points is not
      enough to bring the highlord back above the threshold of death, then the
      highlord still dies. This is a death effect, and he may not choose a
      creature immune to death effects to die in his stead.

      </p><p>A member of the collective may attempt to resist this effect with a
      Will save (DC 20 + the highlord's Charisma modifier). If they succeed, the
      highlord dies as normal.

      </p>
