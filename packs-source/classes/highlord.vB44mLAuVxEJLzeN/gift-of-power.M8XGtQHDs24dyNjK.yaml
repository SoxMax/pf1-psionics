  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 3rd level, the highlord is capable of sharing a portion of his power
      with his allies. The highlord chooses a power that he can manifest. This
      power gains the Network descriptor when manifested by the highlord. At 6th
      level, and every three levels thereafter, the highlord can choose an
      additional power of a different level that he can manifest to give the
      Network descriptor to. Whenever the highlord gains a level, he may change
      which powers to grant the Network descriptor to. However, any power that
      the highlord chooses must be the same level as the power he is changing it
      from.
