        Caltrop Wound</strong><em>: </em>If you are wounded by stepping on a
        caltrop, your speed is reduced to one-half normal. A successful
        Autohypnosis check removes this movement penalty. The wound doesn’t go
        away—it is just ignored through
        self-persuasion.</p><p><strong>Memorize:</strong><em> </em>You can
        attempt to memorize a long string of numbers, a long passage of verse,
        or some other particularly difficult piece of information (but you can’t
        memorize magical writing or similarly exotic scripts). Each successful
        check allows you to memorize a single page of text (up to 800 words),
        numbers, diagrams, or sigils (even if you don’t recognize their
        meaning). If a document is longer than one page, you can make additional
        checks for each additional page. You always retain this information;
        however, you can recall it only with another successful Autohypnosis
        check.</p><p><strong>Resist Dying:</strong> You can attempt to
        subconsciously prevent yourself from dying. If you have negative hit
        points and are losing hit points (at 1 per round, 1 per hour), you can
        substitute a DC 15 Autohypnosis check for your Constitution check to see
        if you become stable. If the check is successful, you stop losing hit
        points (you do not gain any hit points, however, as a result of the
        check). You can substitute this check for the Constitution check in
        later rounds if you are initially unsuccessful.</p><p><strong>Resist
        Fear:</strong><em> </em>In response to any fear effect, you make a
        saving throw normally. If you fail the saving throw, you can make an
        Autohypnosis check on your next round even while overcome by fear. If
        your Autohypnosis check meets or beats the DC for the fear effect, you
        may make an additional Will save with a +4 competence bonus to shrug off
        the fear. On a failed check, the fear affects you normally, and you gain
        no further attempts to shrug off that particular fear
        effect.</p><p><strong>Tolerate Poison:</strong><em> </em>You can attempt
        to resist the effect of any standard poison. Every time you make a
        saving throw against the poison, you make an Autohypnosis check. If your
        Autohypnosis check exceeds the DC of the poison, you receive a +4
        competence bonus on your saving throw against the poison. This skill has
        no effect on the initial saving throw against
        poison.</p><p><strong>Willpower:</strong> If reduced to 0 hit points
        (disabled), you can make an Autohypnosis check. If successful, you can
        take a standard action while at 0 hit points without taking 1 point of
        damage (or any other action the DM deems strenuous, including some free
        actions such as casting a quickened spell). You must make a check for
        each strenuous action you want to take. A failed Autohypnosis check in
        this circumstance carries no direct penalty— you can choose not to take
        the strenuous action and thus avoid the hit point loss. If you do so
        anyway, you drop to -1 hit points, as normal when
        disabled.</p><p><strong>Action: </strong>Typically none. Making an
        Autohypnosis check usually doesn’t require an action; it is either a
        free action (when attempted reactively) or part of another action (when
        attempted actively).</p><p><strong>Try Again: </strong>Yes, for memorize
        and willpower uses, though a success doesn’t cancel the effects of a
        previous failure. No for the other uses.</p>
